\pard\sa80\cf1\fs20\lang1033 Banthas are a species of large, hairy mammals with sharp, spiraling horns. They are native to the desert planet Tatooine, though they are bred on many worlds throughout the galaxy. They are social herd animals, and are often domesticated, and used prominently, by Tusken Raiders as mounts and companions.\par
