\pard\sa80\cf1\fs20\lang1033 Dewbacks are large, four-legged, omnivorous, cold-blooded reptiles native to the Dune Sea of Tatooine. As such, they are well-adapted to the harsh desert climate. This and the fact that they could be easily domesticated made them commonly employed as beasts of burden by both the inhabitants of the desert planet and the off-worlders wandering its dunes. Due to their numerous useful traits and versatility, they are quite possibly the most respected of all the creatures native to Tatooine.\par
