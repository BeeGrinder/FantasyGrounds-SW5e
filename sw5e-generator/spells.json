If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the hallucination is an illusion, and the power ends.\r\n\r\nWhile a target is affected by the power, the target treats the hallucination as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the hallucination. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.\r\n\r\nAn affected target is so convinced of the hallucination's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A hallucination created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a hallucination created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the hallucination can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the hallucination's area or within 5 feet of the hallucination, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force power slot of 3rd level or higher, the range increases by 20 feet, the image dimensions increase by 5 feet, and you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 2nd.",

    "description": "You sublimate yourself before the will of the Force, attempting to use it to affect change in the galaxy around you. \r\n\r\nThe basic use of this power is to duplicate any other light side or universal force power of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that power; it simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\r\n- You summon one object to you of up to 250,000 cr in value that isn't an enhanced item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\r\n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the *improved restoration* power.\r\n- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\r\n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single power or other specific enhanced effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to the Manifestation of Abeloth's Will ability.\r\n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, *will of the force* could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\r\n\r\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This power might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary enhanced item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.\r\n\r\nThe stress of casting this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another power weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a power until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that power, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. Additionally, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Additionally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast *will of the force* ever again if you suffer this stress. Finally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points as a result of this necrotic damage, or at any point before you have fully recovered from the Strength reduction, you immediately die and cannot be resurrected as your body fades away, absorbed into the living Force.",
