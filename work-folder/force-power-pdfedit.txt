You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the
ground that you can see within range. For the duration,
an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-
foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes
creatures and structures in contact with the ground in
that area.
The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each
creature on the ground that is concentrating must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature’s concentration is broken.
When you cast this power and at the end of each turn
you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the

This power can have additional effects depending on
the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by

opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a
fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with
the fissure’s edge as it opens.

automatically collapse (see below).
Structures. The tremor deals 50 kinetic damage to
any structure in contact with the ground in the area
when you cast the power and at the start of each of
your turns until the power ends. If a structure drops to
0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages
nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of
a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 kinetic
damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble,
requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action

appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you
can target the ground under a creature if that creature
is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit
points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles
into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain
with a 10 - foot radius that lasts until the rubble is
cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area
requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted
by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.
If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height
because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the
pillar takes 6d6 kinetic damage and is restrained,
pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The
restrained creature can use an action to make a
Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice)
against the power’s save DC. On a success, the creature

pillar or fall off it.

A 10-foot-radius faintly shimmering barrier surrounds
you. Within the sphere, powers can’t be cast and
enhanced items become mundane. Until the power
ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.
Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed
in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended
to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an
effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it
spends suppressed counts against its duration.
Targeted Eflflects. Powers and other enhanced effects
that target a creature or an object in the sphere have
no effect on that target.
Enhanced Areas. The area of another power or
enhanced effect, such as force storm, can’t extend into
the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area,
the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is
suppressed.
Powers. Any active power or other enhanced effect
on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed
while the creature or object is in it.
Enhanced Items. The properties and powers of
enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For
example, a +1 vibrosword in the sphere functions as an
unenhanced vibrosword.
An enhanced weapon’s properties and powers are
suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced
weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves
the sphere (for example, if you flre an enhanced shot or
throw an enhanced saberspear at a target outside the
sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be
suppressed as soon as it exits.

sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the
departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to
another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.
Creatures and Objects. A creature or object
summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out
of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly
reappears once the space the creature occupied is no
longer within the sphere.
