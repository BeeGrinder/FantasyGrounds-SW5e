ABSORB ENERGY
1st-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you take
acid, cold, energy, . re, ion, kinetic, lightning, or sonic
damage
Range: Self
Duration: 1 round
The power captures some of the incoming energy,
lessening its e􀃗ect on you and storing it for your next
melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering
damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the
􀃒rst time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn,
the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering
type, and the power ends.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
power slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
ACID DART
2nd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
A shimmering green dart streaks toward a target
within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a
ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the
target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid
damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the dart
splashes the target with acid for half as much of the
initial damage and no damage at the end of its next
turn.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial
and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above
2nd.
ACID SPLASH
At-will tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
You emit a burst of acid. Choose one creature within
range, or choose two creatures within range that are
within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.
This power’s damage increases by 1d6 when you
reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level
(4d6).
ALARM
1st-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 30 feet
Duration: 8 hours
You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose
a door, a window, or an area within range that is no
larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the power ends, an
alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature
touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the
power, you can designate creatures that won’t set o􀃗
the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental
or audible.
A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if
you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping
awakens you if you are sleeping.
An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell
for 10 seconds within 60 feet.
ANALYZE
1st-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Duration: Instantaneous
You choose one object that you must touch
throughout the casting of the power. If it is an
enhanced or modi􀃒ed item, you learn its properties and
how to use them, whether it requires attunement to
use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn
whether any powers are a􀃗ecting the item and what
they are. If the item was created by a power, you learn
which power created it.
If you instead touch a creature throughout the
casting, you learn what tech powers, if any, are
currently a􀃗ecting it.
ANTIPATHY/SYMPATHY
8th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 60 feet
Duration: 10 days
This power attracts or repels creatures of your
choice. You target something within range, either a
Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no
larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of
intelligent creature, such as rancors, kath hounds, or
twi'leks. You invest the target with an aura that either
attracts or repels the speci􀃒ed creatures for the
duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s
e􀃗ect.
Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the
kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the
area and avoid the target. When such a creature can
see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can
see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened
by the target, the creature must use its movement to
move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see
the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet
from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no
longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened
again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60
feet of it.
Sympathy. The enchantment causes the speci􀃒ed
creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target
while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a
creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it,
the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the
area or move within reach of the target. When the
creature has done so, it can’t willingly move away from
the target.
If the target damages or otherwise harms an a􀃗ected
creature, the a􀃗ected creature can make a Wisdom
saving throw to end the e􀃗ect, as described below.
Ending the E􀃗􀃗ect. If an a􀃗ected creature ends its
turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see
it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a
successful save, the creature is no longer a􀃗ected by
the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or
attraction as unnatural. In addition, a creature a􀃗ected
by the power is allowed another Wisdom saving throw
every 24 hours while the power persists.
A creature that successfully saves against this e􀃗ect is
immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be
a􀃗ected again.
ASSESS THE SITUATION
At-will tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
You take a sensory snapshot of a target within range.
Your tech grants you a brief insight into the target’s
defenses. You have advantage on the next attack roll
you make against the target before the end of your next

BALLISTIC SHIELD
4th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

damage.
CAGE
7th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Duration: 1 hour
An immobile, Invisible, cube-shaped prison
composed of energy springs into existence around an
area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage
or a solid box as you choose.
A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet
on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars
spaced 1/2 inch apart.
A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on
a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter
from passing through it and blocking any powers cast
into or out of the area.
When you cast the power, any creature that is
completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures
only partially within the area, or those too large to 􀃒t
inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the
area until they are completely outside the area.
A creature inside the cage can't leave it by
unenhanced means. If the creature tries to teleport to
leave the cage, it must 􀃒rst make a Charisma saving
throw. On a success, the creature can use that power to
exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the
cage and wastes the use of the power or e􀃗ect.
This power can't be dispelled.
CARBONITE
6th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to freeze one creature that you can see
within range into carbonite. The creature must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is
restrained as its 􀃓esh begins to harden. On a successful
save, the creature isn’t a􀃗ected.
A creature restrained by this power must make
another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of
its turns. If it successfully saves against this power three
times, the power ends. If it fails its saves three times, it
is turned to stone and subjected to the petri􀃒ed
condition for the duration. The successes and failures
don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until
the target collects three of a kind.
If the creature is physically broken while frozen in
carbonite, it su􀃗ers from similar deformities if it reverts
to its original state.
If you maintain your concentration on this power for
the entire possible duration, the creature is frozen in
carbonite until the e􀃗ect is removed.

6th-level tech power
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Self
Duration: 10 days
Choose a tech power of 5th-level or lower that you
can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that
can target you. You cast that power, called the
contingent power, as part of casting contingency,
expending tech points for both, but the contingent
power doesn't come into e􀃗ect. Instead, it takes e􀃗ect
when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that
circumstance when you cast the two powers.
The contingent power takes e􀃗ect immediately after
the circumstance is met for the 􀃒rst time, whether or
not you want it to, and then contingency ends.
The contingent power takes e􀃗ect only on you, even
if it can normally target others. You can use only one
contingency power at a time. If you cast this power
again, the e􀃗ect of another contingency power on you
ends. Also, contingency ends on you if your wristpad is
ever not on your person.

use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or
a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s

If the creature attempts to cast a power with a casting

Range: 150 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
You create an explosion at a point within range. Each
creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that
point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target
takes 8d6 􀃒re damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
The 􀃒re spreads around corners. It ignites 􀃓ammable
objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
FIND THE PATH
6th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 day
This power allows you to 􀃒nd the shortest, most
direct physical route to a speci􀃒c 􀃒xed location that you
are familiar with on the same planet. If you name a
destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a
destination that isn’t speci􀃒c (such as “a Black Sun lair”),
the power fails.
For the duration, as long as you are on the same
planet as the destination, you know how far it is and in
what direction it lies. While you are traveling there,
whenever you are presented with a choice of paths
along the way, you automatically determine which path
is the shortest and most direct route (but not
necessarily the safest route) to the destination.
FIRESTORM
6th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
Choose a point on the ground within range,
incinerating everything in a 15-foot radius. All creatures
must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d8 􀃒re
damage on a failure or half as much on a success. All
large or smaller creatures are pushed to the edge of the
power’s radius. You may choose one creature to be at
the very center of the 􀃒restorm, if you do so that
creature has disadvantage on its saving throw and is
knocked prone on a failure.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 and the radius increases by 5 feet for each slot
level above 6th.
FLAME SWEEP
1st-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot cone)
Duration: Instantaneous
A thin sheet of 􀃓ames shoots forth from your
wristpad. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 􀃒re
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
The 􀃒re ignites any 􀃓ammable objects in the area that
aren’t being worn or carried.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
FLAMING SHOTS
3rd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You channel tech power through a blaster weapon
you are wielding. When a target takes damage from the
chosen weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 􀃒re
damage. The power ends when twelve shots have been
􀃒red.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 4th level or higher, the number of shots you
can take with this power increases by two for each slot
level above 3rd.
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
4th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the
target's movement is una􀃗ected by di􀃕cult terrain, and
powers can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause
the target to be paralyzed or restrained.
The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to
automatically escape from restraints, such as manacles
or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being
underwater imposes no penalties on the target's
movement or attacks.
GLEAMING OUTLINE
1st-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined
in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature
in the area when the power is cast is also outlined in
light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration,
objects and a􀃗ected creatures shed dim light in a 10-
foot radius.
Any attack roll against an a􀃗ected creature or object
has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the
a􀃗ected creature or object can’t bene􀃒t from being
invisible.
GREATER EXPLOSION
9th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
You expell a massive explosion at a point within
range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere
centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving
throw. A target takes 40d6 􀃒re damage and is knocked
prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one but remain standing.
The 􀃒re spreads around corners. It ignites 􀃓ammable
objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
GREATER IMAGE
3rd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create an image no larger than a 20 foot cube. It
appears at a spot you can see and lasts for the
duration. It seems completely real, sounds and other
sensory e􀃗ects included. You can't create a sensory
e􀃗ect strong enough to cause damage or a condition.
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you
can use your action to make the image to move to any
other spot within range. As the image changes location,
you can alter it so that its movements appear natural
for the image.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it as an
illusion. A creature can use its action to determine that
it's an illusion with a successful Investigation check. If a
creature learns it's an illusion, it can see through the
image, and the other sensory qualities become faint to
it.
Overcharge Tech. The power lasts until dispelled
without requiring concentration if cast at 6th-level or
higher.
GREATER LIGHT
3rd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60
Duration: 1 hour
A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads from a point
you choose. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim
light for an additional 60 feet.
If you chose an object you are holding or one that
isn't being worn or carried, the light shines from and
moves with the object. Completely covering the object
with something opaque blocks the light.
If any of this power's area overlaps with enhanced
darkness made by a power of 3rd level or lower, the
darkness is dispelled.
GREATER SABOTAGE CHARGES
7th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create six medium sabotage charges that last for
the power's duration. When you cast the power, and as
a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can hurl up to
two of the charges to points you choose within 120 feet.
Each charge explodes if it reaches the point or hits a
solid surface. Each creature within 10 feet of the
explosion must make a Dexterity save. The explosion
deals 4d6 􀃒re damage on a failure, or half damage on a
success.
Overcharge Tech. The number of charges created
increases by two for each slot level above 7th.
GREATER SALVO
9th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
You launch four projectiles at points you can see
within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius must
make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6
􀃒re damage and 20d6 kinetic damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature
in the area of more than one 􀃒ery burst is a􀃗ected only
once.
The power damages objects in the area and ignites
􀃓ammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
GREATER TRANSLOCATE
5th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Your form shimmers in a holographic con􀃒guration,
and then collapses. You teleport up to 60 feet to an
unoccupied space that you can see. On each of your
turns before the power ends, you can use a bonus
action to teleport in this way again.
GROUP IMAGE
5th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Duration: 8 hours
This power allows you to change the appearance of
any number of creatures that you can see within range.
You give each target you choose a new, illusory
appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma
saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is una􀃗ected by this
power.
The power disguises physical appearance as well as
clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can
make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and
appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a
target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has
the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the
extent of the illusion is up to you. The power lasts for
the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it
sooner.
The changes wrought by this power fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, if you use this power
to add a hat to a creature’s out􀃒t, objects pass through
the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing
or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use
this power to appear thinner than you are, the hand of
someone who reaches out to touch you would bump
into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
A creature can use its action to inspect a target and
make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
tech save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the
target is disguised.
GUARDS AND WARDS
6th-level tech power
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Duration: 24 hours
You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square
feet of 􀃓oor space (an area 50 feet square, or one
hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-􀃒ve 10-foot squares).
The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped
as you desire. You can ward several stories of a
stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as
you can walk into each contiguous area while you are
casting the power.
When you cast this power, you can specify individuals
that are una􀃗ected by any or all of the e􀃗ects that you
choose. You can also specify a password that, when
spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these
e􀃗ects.
Guards and wards creates the following e􀃗ects within
the warded area.
Corridors. Fog 􀃒lls all the warded corridors, making
them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection
or branching passage o􀃗ering a choice of direction,
there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than
you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from
the one it chooses.
Doors. All doors in the warded area are locked, as if
sealed by the lock power. In addition, you can cover up
to ten doors with an image (equivalent to the illusory
object function of the minor image power) to make
them appear as plain sections of wall.
Stairs. Electromesh 􀃒lls all stairs in the warded area
from top to bottom, as the electromesh power. This
mesh regrows in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away
while guards and wards lasts.
Other power E􀃗􀃗ect. You can place your choice of
one of the following enhanced e􀃗ects within the
warded area of the stronghold.
Place mobile lights in four corridors. You can designate
a simple program that the lights repeat as long as
guards and wards lasts.
Place implant message in two locations.
Place debilitating gas in two locations. The vapors
appear in the places you designate; they return within
10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards
lasts.
The whole warded area radiates power. A dimish tech
cast on a speci􀃒c e􀃗ect, if successful, removes only that
e􀃗ect.
You can create a permanently guarded and warded
structure by casting this power there every day for one
year.
HOLD DROID
2nd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You emit a paralyzing dart at a droid or construct that
you can see within range. The target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for the
duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can
make another Constitution saving throw. On a success,
the power ends on the target.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional droid or construct for each slot level above
2nd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other
when you target them.
HUNTER'S MARK
1st-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 90 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You choose a creature you can see within range and
mark it as your quarry. Until the power ends, you deal
an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it
with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any
Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you
make to 􀃒nd it. If the target drops to 0 hit points before
this power ends, you can use a bonus action on a
subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your
concentration on the power for up to 8 hours. When
you use a tech slot of 5th level or higher, you can
maintain your concentration on the power for up to 24
hours.
IMAGE
1st-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create an image that is no larger than a 15-foot
cube. The image appears at a spot within range and
lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual. If
anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an
illusion.
You can use your action to cause the image to move
to any spot within range. As the image changes
location, you can alter its appearance so that its
movements appear natural for the image.
A creature that uses its action to examine the image
can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save
DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the
creature can see through the image.
IMMOLATE
5th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Flames wreathe one creature you can see within
range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw.
It takes 8d6 􀃒re damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the
target also burns for the power’s duration. The burning
target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim
light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its
turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6
􀃒re damage on a failed save, and the power ends on a
successful one. These enhanced 􀃓ames can’t be
extinguished by unenhanced means.
If damage from this power kills a target, the target is
turned to ash.
IMPLANT MESSAGE
2nd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 30 feet
Duration: Until dispelled
You implant a message within an object in range, a
message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met.
Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being
worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the
message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can
be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally,
determine the circumstance that will trigger the power
to deliver your message.
When that circumstance occurs, the message is
recited in your voice and at the same volume you
spoke. When you cast this power, you can have the
power end after it delivers its message, or it can remain
and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.
The triggering circumstance can be as general or as
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual
or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the
object. For example, you could instruct the message to
play when any creature moves within 30 feet of the
object or when a bell rings within 30 feet of it.
INCENDIARY CLOUD
8th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a swirling cloud of smoke shot through
with white-hot embers in a 20-foot-radius sphere
centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads
around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the
duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed
(at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
When the cloud appears, each creature in it must
make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8
􀃒re damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one. A creature must also make this
saving throw when it enters the power’s area for the
􀃒rst time on a turn or ends its turn there.
The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a
direction that you choose at the start of each of your
turns.
INFILTRATE
2nd-level tech power

Droids and constructs have disadvantage on this saving
throw.
This power’s damage increases by 1d4 when you
reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level
(4d4).
IONIC BOND
1st-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 30 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam of ion energy lances out toward a creature
within range, forming a sustained line between you and
the target. Make a ranged tech attack against that
creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 ion damage, and
on each of your turns for the duration, you can use a
bonus action to deal 1d8 ion damage to the target
automatically. The power ends if you use your bonus
action to do anything else. The power also ends if the
target is ever outside the power’s range or if it has total
cover from you.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage
increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
JET OF FLAME
At-will tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot sphere)
Duration: 10 minutes
A 􀃓ickering 􀃓ame appears in your hand. The 􀃓ame
remains there for the duration and harms neither you
nor your equipment. The 􀃓ame sheds bright light in a
10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
The power ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you
cast it again.
You can also attack with the 􀃓ame, although doing so
ends the power. When you cast this power, or as an
action on a later turn, you can hurl the 􀃓ame at a
creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged tech
attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 􀃒re damage.

Duration: 8 hours
You touch a creature and grant it a small reserve of
kolto. The 􀃒rst time the target would drop to 0 hit
points as a result of taking damage, the target instead
drops to 1 hit point, and the power ends. If the power is
still in e􀃗ect when the target is subjected to an e􀃗ect
that would kill it instantaneously without dealing

target, and the powers ends.
KOLTO WAVES
9th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
A 􀃓ood of kolto energy 􀃓ows from you into injured

e􀃗ect on droids or constructs.
LIGHT
At-will tech power
Casting Time: 1 action

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in
any dimension. Until the power ends, the object sheds
bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an
additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like.
Completely covering the object with something opaque
blocks the light. The power ends if you cast it again or

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile
creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw to avoid the power.
LOCK
2nd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Duration: Until dispelled
You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or
other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration.
You and the creatures you designate when you cast this
power can open the object normally. You can also set a
password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object,
suppresses this power for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is
impassable until it is broken or the power is dispelled or
suppressed. Casting release on the object suppresses
lock for 10 minutes.
While a􀃗ected by this power, the object is more
di􀃕cult to break or force open; the DC to break it or
pick any locks on it increases by 10.

MENDING
At-will tech power
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Duration: Instantaneous
This ability repairs a single break or tear in an object
you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a

MINOR IMAGE
At-will tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10 feet
Duration: Up to 1 hour
This ability is a minor tech trick that creates one of
the following e􀃗ects within range.

You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger
than 1 cubic foot.
You chill, warm, or 􀃓avor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving
material for 1 hour.

an object or a surface for 1 hour.
You create a trinket or an illusory image that can 􀃒t in
your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

MIRROR IMAGE
2nd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Duration: 1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your
space. Until the power ends, the duplicates move with
you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s
impossible to track which image is real. You can use
your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
Each time a creature targets you with an attack
during the power’s duration, roll a d20 to determine
whether the attack instead targets one of your
duplicates.
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or
higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With
two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one
duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modi􀃒er.
If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed.
A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits
it. It ignores all other damage and e􀃗ects. The power
ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is una􀃗ected by this power if it can’t see, if
it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight,
or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.
MISLEAD
5th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You become invisible at the same time that an
illusory double of you appears where you are standing.
The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility
ends if you attack or cast a power.
You can use your action to move your illusory double
up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and
behave in whatever way you choose.
You can see through its eyes and hear through its
ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your
turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its
senses to using your own, or back again. While you are
using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in
regard to your own surroundings.
MOBILE LIGHTS
At-will tech power

You create up to four orbs of light within range that
hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine
the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form
of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light
sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the
lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light
must be within 20 feet of another light created by this
power, and a light winks out if it exceeds the power’s
range.
OIL SLICK
1st-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: 1 minute

the power ends, you can use a bonus action on each of
your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.
If a creature is holding or wearing the object and

You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited
ability to see into the immediate future. For the

This power immediately ends if you cast it again
before its duration ends.
PROGRAMMED ILLUSION
6th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Duration: Until dispelled
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon within range that
activates when a speci􀃒c condition occurs. The illusion
is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a
30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the power
how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes.
This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.
When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion
springs into existence and performs in the manner you
described. Once the illusion 􀃒nishes performing, it
disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After
this time, the illusion can be activated again.
The triggering condition can be as general or as
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual
or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the
area. For example, you could create an illusion of
yourself to appear and warn o􀃗 others who attempt to
open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to
trigger only when a creature says the correct word or
phrase.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can
determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save
DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the
creature can see through the image, and any noise it
makes sounds hollow to the creature.
PROJECT IMAGE
7th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 500 miles
Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours
You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for
the duration. The copy can appear at any location
within range that you have seen before, regardless of
intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like
you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it
disappears, and the power ends.
You can use your action to move this illusion up to
twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and
behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your
mannerisms perfectly.
You can see through its eyes and hear through its
ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus
action, you can switch from using its senses to using
your own, or back again. While you are using its senses,
you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own
surroundings.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can
determine that it is an illusion with a successful

DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the
creature can see through the image, and any noise it
makes sounds hollow to the creature.

stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or
unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of
them is unlocked.

power is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time
the target can be opened and shut normally.

pass through it on their turn take 1d6 􀃒re damage.
Creatures within the ring of 􀃒re who willingly try to
move through the 􀃒re to escape must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw to do so. Creatures who are
immune to fear or 􀃒re automatically succeed on this
saving throw.

SCRAMBLING FIELD
8th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 acion
Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A 10-foot-radius shimmering sphere of power
suppression surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers
can’t be cast and enhanced items become mundane.
Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you,
centered on you.
Powers and other enhanced e􀃗ects are suppressed
in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended
to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an
e􀃗ect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it
spends suppressed counts against its duration.
Targeted E􀃗􀃗ects. Powers and other enhanced e􀃗ects
that target a creature or an object in the sphere have
no e􀃗ect on that target.
Enhanced Areas. The area of another power or
enhanced e􀃗ect, such as explosion, can’t extend into
the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area,
the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is
suppressed.
Powers. Any active power or other enhanced e􀃗ect
on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed
while the creature or object is in it.
Enhanced Items. The properties and powers of
enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For
example, a +1 lightsaber in the sphere functions as an
unenhanced lightsaber.
An enhanced weapon’s properties and powers are
suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced
weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves
the sphere (for example, if you 􀃒re an enhanced shot or
throw an enhanced vibrospear at a target outside the
sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be
suppressed as soon as it exits.
Enhanced Travel. Teleportation fails to work in the
sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the
departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to
another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.
Creatures and Objects. A creature or object
summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out
of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly
reappears once the space the creature occupied is no
longer within the sphere.
Tech Override/Sever Force. Powers and enhanced
e􀃗ects such as tech override have no e􀃗ect on the
sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by di􀃗erent
scrambling 􀃒eld powers don’t nullify each other.
SCRAMBLING SHIELD
6th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into
existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains
for the duration.
Any tech power of 5th level or lower cast from
outside the barrier can't a􀃗ect creatures or objects
within it, even if the power is cast using a higher level
tech slot. Such a power can target creatures and objects
within the barrier, but the power has no e􀃗ect on them.
Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from
the areas a􀃗ected by such powers.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks
powers of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.
SENDING
3rd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Unlimited
Duration: 1 round
You send a short message of twenty-􀃒ve words or
less to a creature with which you are familiar that
possesses a commlink. The creature hears the
message, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you,
and can answer in a like manner immediately.
You can send the message across any distance and
even to other planets, but if the target is on a di􀃗erent
planet than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the
message doesn’t arrive.
SENSOR PROBE
4th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create a small, temporary, invisible probe that
hovers in the air for the duration. You mentally receive
visual information from the probe. It has darkvision out
to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.
As an action, you can move the probe up to 30 feet in
any direction. There's no limit on how far away from
you it can be. A solid barrier blocks the probe's
movement, but it can pass through an opening at least
1 inch in diameter.
SHARED SHIELDING
2nd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch

you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it
has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes
damage, you take the same amount of damage.
The power ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you
and the target become separated by more than 60 feet.
It also ends if the power is cast again on either of the
connected creatures. You can also dismiss the power as
an action.
SHATTER
2nd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet

make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8
sonic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic
material such as stone, crystal, or metal has
disadvantage on this saving throw.
An unenhanced object that isn’t being worn or carried
also takes the damage if it’s in the power's area.

tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

STORMING SHOT
At-will tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
As a part of the action used to cast this power, you
must make an attack with a ranged weapon against one
creature within the power's range, otherwise the power
fails. On a hit, the target su􀃗ers the attack's normal
e􀃗ects and gains the lightning rod debu􀃗 until the end
of your next turn, as energy begins to course through
them. When this power hits a target, if there is a
creature within 30 ft who has the lightning rod debu􀃗,
then the energy discharges, creating an arc of lightning
between them which removes the debu􀃗 and deals 1d6
lightning damage to each of them.
The power's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the e􀃗ects of both the ranged
weapon attack and discharge deal an extra 1d6
lightning damage. Both damage rolls increase by an
additional 1d6 at 11th and 17th level.

SYNCHRONICITY
4th-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A creature you touch isn't inconvenienced by
mundane delays. Tra􀃕c lights are always green, there's
always a waiting elevator, and a taxi is always around
the corner. The target can run at full speed through
dense crowds and attacks of opportunity provoked by
the target's movement are made with disadvantage.
The power also grants advantage to stealth checks,
since cover is always available. Additionally, the target
has advantage on all ability checks made to drive a
vehicle.
If two or more creatures under the e􀃗ect of the
power are attempting to avoid being inconvenienced by
each other, the creatures make Charisma checks each

each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the
ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the
lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

You interface a tracker droid with your wristpad,
creating a permanent link.
Your tracker droid acts independently of you, but it
always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its
own initiative and acts on its own turn. A tracker droid
can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
While your tracker droid is within 100 feet of you, you
can communicate with it via your wristpad. Additionally,
as an action, you can see through your droid’s vision
and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn,
gaining the bene􀃒ts of any special senses that the droid
has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with
regard to your own senses.
You can’t maintain an interface between more than
one tracker droid and your wristpad at a time.
Finally, when you cast a tech power with a range of
touch, your tracker can deliver the power as if it had
cast it. Your tracker droid must be within 100 feet of
you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power
when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll,
you use your attack modi􀃒er for the roll.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can maintain a link
with one more tracker droid for every two slot levels
above 1st. Multiple tracker droids act on the same
initiative. You can only see through one droid's vision at
a time, but you can toggle between droids as a bonus
action. Each droid must still be within 100 feet of you.
TRANQUILIZER
1st-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Duration: 1 minute
You emit a tranquilizing dart that knocks a creature
unconscious. Roll 5d8; if the creature's remaining hit
points are less than the total, the creature falls
unconscious until the power ends, the sleeper takes
damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap
the sleeper awake. This power has no e􀃗ect on droids
or constructs.
Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a
tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an
additional creature for each slot level above 1st. For
each target, roll 5d8 separately.
TRANSLOCATE
2nd-level tech power
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self

Your form shimmers in a holographic con􀃒guration,
and then collapses. You teleport up to 30 feet to an
unoccupied space that you can see.
VORTEX DART
At-will tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
As part of the action used to cast this power, you
must make a ranged attack with a weapon against one
creature within the power’s range, otherwise the power
fails. On a hit, the target su􀃗ers the attack’s normal
e􀃗ects, and each Large or smaller creature within 10
feet of the target must succeed on a Strength saving
throw or be pulled to the nearest unoccupied space
adjacent to the target.
At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6
energy damage to the target. This extra damage
increases by 1d6 again at 11th level and 17th level.
WARD
At-will tech power
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Duration: 1 round
Until the end of your next turn, you have resistance
against kinetic and energy damage dealt by weapon
attacks.
