# FantasyGrounds-SW5e
#### A FantasyGrounds module to implement SW5e game

#### User Information

SW5e is a user created (Homebrew) set of Races, Classes, NPCs, etc. that works within the 5e ruleset.

[SW5e Website](http://star-wars-5e.azurewebsites.net/)

 |Sub-Project | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | -- |
|Player Book | In Progress | pre-pre-alpha state. Many issues. |
|NPC Book | Released | Give it a try |
|Ruleset Extension | Released | Ready to go |

When creating your new campaign in FG for SW5e, select the 5e ruleset.  All the SW5e content is dependent on the base 5e ruleset.  Note: It's best to only load SW5e modules and extensions. Other modules may contain 5e NPCs, Classes, etc. that are not compatible with the SW5e modified rules.

To install the module(s) for use in FantasyGrounds, download the file(s) in the module directory of this project into your Fantasy Grounds modules directory *(...\Fantasy Grounds\modules)*.  Then load sw5e modules using the Library->Modules selections.

To install the extension, download *__sw5e.ext__* and place in your extensions directory *(...\Fantasy Grounds\extensions)*. When creating/loading your campaign, make sure to select extension *__sw5e__* from the list.

#### Developer Information

The *__par5e__* directory is for the text files that are parsed into the *__Player Book__* module and the "source" of the module content.</p>

The *__NPCEngineer__* directory is for the text files that are parsed into the *__NPC Book__* module and the "source" of the module content. [NPC Engineer website](http://www.masq.net/)

The *__ext-src__* dirctory is for the extension sources.
