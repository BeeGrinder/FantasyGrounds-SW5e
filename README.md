### Fantasy Grounds User Information

#### Installation

* To install the module(s) for use in FantasyGrounds, download the file(s) in the module directory of this project into your Fantasy Grounds modules directory *(...\Fantasy Grounds\modules)*.  Then load sw5e modules using the Library->Modules selections.
* To install the extension, download *__sw5e.ext__* and place in your extensions directory *(...\Fantasy Grounds\extensions)*. When creating/loading your campaign, make sure to select extension *__sw5e__* from the list.

#### Creating your sw5e campaign

* When creating your new campaign in FG for SW5e, select the 5e ruleset (All the SW5e content is dependent on the base 5e ruleset).
* Once you select the 5e rule set, the sw5e extenstion will appear in the extension window.  Select it.

  Note: It's best to only load SW5e modules and extensions. I cannot guarantee compatibility with other module or extensions.
* Once your campaign opens, go to *__Library__* then *__Modules__* and open both *__SW5e Player Book__* and *__SW5e NPC Manual__*.

### Developer Information

The *__par5e__* directory is for the text files that are parsed into the *__Player Book__* module and the "source" of the module content.</p>

The *__NPCEngineer__* directory is for the text files that are parsed into the *__NPC Book__* module and the "source" of the module content. [NPC Engineer website](http://www.masq.net/)
