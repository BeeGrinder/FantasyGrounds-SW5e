# FantasyGrounds-SW5e
#### A FantasyGrounds module to implement SW5e game

SW5e is a user created (Home-brew) set of Races, Classes, NPCs, etc. that works within the 5e ruleset.

#### This Version (2.0.0)

This version accompanies the PHB and Scum and Villiany PDFs that were release/available in March 2020.

[SW5e S&V](https://mega.nz/file/TM8kVYaa#YcHsUUW5fi0CitCX_hQ1cXMLhZpqdKubP_PwCWzLvk4)

This was announced to be the "Final Release" of the PHB

Since this "Final Release" hundreds of changes and additions have been made to the PHB.  Unlike other publications, where they add new books to add updated content, the SW5e PHB is in constant flux.  Nearly impossible to follow and keep 3rd party systems updated.

So, I'm going to write these modules to a certain
release of the PDFs and provide them as a download so you will be able to play with the appropriate documentation.

### Fantasy Grounds User Information

#### Installation

* To install the module(s) for use in Fantasy Grounds, download the file(s) in the module directory of this project into your Fantasy Grounds modules directory *(...\Fantasy Grounds\modules)*.  Then load sw5e modules using the Library->Modules selections.

   Download module files from [here](https://github.com/BeeGrinder/FantasyGrounds-SW5e/tree/master/modules)
 
* To install the extension, download *__sw5e.ext__* and place in your extensions directory *(...\Fantasy Grounds\extensions)*. When creating/loading your campaign, make sure to select extension *__sw5e__* from the list.  Currently only works with FG Classic.

   Download the extension file from [here](https://github.com/BeeGrinder/FantasyGrounds-SW5e/tree/master/extensions)

* __*IMPORTANT:*__ Read the __Reference__ section of each module in Fantasy Grounds any notes or special instructions.

#### Creating your sw5e campaign

* When creating your new campaign in FG for SW5e, select the 5e rule-set (All the SW5e content is dependent on the base 5e rule-set).
* Once you select the 5e rule-set, the sw5e extension will appear in the extension window.  Select the SW5e extension.

  Note: It's best to only load SW5e modules and extensions. I cannot guarantee compatibility with other module or extensions.
* Once your campaign opens, go to *__Library__* then *__Modules__* and open the *__SW5e Player Book__*, *__SW5e Supplement__*, and *__SW5e NPC Manual__*.

__New Starship Rules__

At this time none of the Starship combat rules will be added to my modules.  It is not compatible with the 5e ruleset and will require extensive extension development.
