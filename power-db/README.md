## SW5e/FantasyGrounds power-db

This program will be used to perform the following functions

-  Gather latest spells(powers) from the sw5e.com website JSON.
-  Import the existing spells from the FG XML.
-  Reconcile the differences if any.
-  Allow update of the actions section of new spells.
-  Generate updated XML for Fantasy Grounds

Ultimately the goal is to append the items(equipment), starting equipment packs(treasureparcels), and spells (powers) to the XML output generated by PAR5e.

The output of PAR5e is less than 100% usable.  The changes required to the output, plus these added sections (items and spells) will create a single FG module for the basic SW5e PHB and MM content.
