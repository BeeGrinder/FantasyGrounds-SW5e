## SW5e/FantasyGrounds power-db

This program is a temporary utility I am using while migrating from the older par5e tool to directly gathering updates from the sw5e website json data.

-  Gather latest spells(powers) from the sw5e.com website JSON.
-  Import the existing spells from the previously released Fantasy Grounds sw5e module XML.
-  Reconcile and issues with the data.  Especially coded spell actions.

This program should prepare usable data, but not alter it for a module update.  The module update will be done in the program sw5e-generator.
