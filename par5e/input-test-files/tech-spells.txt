Guards and Wards
6th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components:
Duration: 24 hours
You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the power.
When you cast this power, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.
Corridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.
Doors. All doors in the warded area are locked, as if sealed by the lock power. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an image (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor image power) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
Stairs. Electromesh fills all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the electromesh power. This mesh regrows in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.
Other power Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following enhanced effects within the warded area of the stronghold.
Place mobile lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.
Place implant message in two locations.
Place debilitating gas in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.
The whole warded area radiates power. A dimish tech cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.
You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this power there every day for one year.

You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the power ends.

Antipathy/Sympathy
8th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 60 feet
Components:
Duration: 10 days
This power attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as rancors, kath hounds, or twi'leks. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.
Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.
Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target.
If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as unnatural. In addition, a creature affected by the power is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the power persists.
A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any powers cast into or out of the area.
When you cast the power, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.
A creature inside the cage can't leave it by unenhanced means. If the creature tries to teleport to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw.

A creature restrained by this power must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this power three times, the power ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.

Gleaming Outline
1st-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components:
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the power is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.
Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

Greater Explosion
9th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components:
Duration: Instantaneous
You expell a massive explosion at a point within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 40d6 fire damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one but remain standing.
The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

Greater Image
3rd-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components:
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create an image no larger than a 20 foot cube. It appears at a spot you can see and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, sounds and other sensory effects included. You can't create a sensory effect strong enough to cause damage or a condition.
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to make the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter it so that its movements appear natural for the image.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it as an illusion. A creature can use its action to determine that it's an illusion with a successful Investigation check. If a creature learns it's an illusion, it can see through the image, and the other sensory qualities become faint to it.
At Higher Levels. The power lasts until dispelled without requiring concentration if cast at 6th-level or higher.

Greater Light
3rd-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60
Components:
Duration: 1 hour
A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads from a point you choose. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.
If you chose an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the light shines from and moves with the object. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light.
If any of this power's area overlaps with enhanced darkness made by a power of 3rd level or lower, the darkness is dispelled.

Greater Sabotage Charges
7th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components:
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create six medium sabotage charges that last for the power's duration. When you cast the power, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can hurl up to two of the charges to points you choose within 120 feet. Each charge explodes if it reaches the point or hits a solid surface. Each creature within 10 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity save. The explosion deals 4d6 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.
At Higher Levels. The number of charges created increases by two for each slot level above 7th.

Greater Salvo
9th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components:
Duration: Instantaneous
You launch four projectiles at points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.
The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

Greater Translocate
5th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components:
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Your form shimmers in a holographic configuration, and then collapses. You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. On each of your turns before the power ends, you can use a bonus action to teleport in this way again.

Group Image
5th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components:
Duration: 8 hours
This power allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this power.
The power disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The power lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
The changes wrought by this power fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this power to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this power to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

Guards and Wards
6th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components:
Duration: 24 hours
You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the power.
When you cast this power, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.
Corridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.
Doors. All doors in the warded area are locked, as if sealed by the lock power. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an image (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor image power) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
Stairs. Electromesh fills all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the electromesh power. This mesh regrows in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.
Other power Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following enhanced effects within the warded area of the stronghold.
Place mobile lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.
Place implant message in two locations.
Place debilitating gas in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.
The whole warded area radiates power. A dimish tech cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.
You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this power there every day for one year.

If the target drops to 0 hit points before this power ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the power for up to 8 hours. When you use a tech slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the power for up to 24 hours.

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create an image that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion.
You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.
A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

Immolate
5th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components:
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the power's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the power ends on a successful one. These enhanced flames can't be extinguished by unenhanced means.
If damage from this power kills a target, the target is turned to ash.

Implant Message
2nd-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 30 feet
Components:
Duration: Until dispelled
You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the power to deliver your message.
When that circumstance occurs, the message is recited in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. When you cast this power, you can have the power end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.
The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the message to play when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a bell rings within 30 feet of it.

It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the power's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.

Mirror Image
2nd-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components:
Duration: 1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the power ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Programmed Illusion
6th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components:
Duration: Until dispelled
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the power how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.
When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.
The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

Project Image
7th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 500 miles
Components:
Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours
You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Scrambling Field
8th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 acion
Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
Components:
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A 10-foot-radius shimmering sphere of power suppression surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.
Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.
Targeted Effects. Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.
Enhanced Areas. The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as explosion, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.
Powers. Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.
Enhanced Items. The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 lightsaber in the sphere functions as an unenhanced lightsaber.
An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an enhanced shot or throw an enhanced vibrospear at a target outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
Enhanced Travel. Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.
Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.
Tech Override/Sever Force. Powers and enhanced effects such as tech override have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different scrambling field powers don't nullify each other.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Components:
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.
Any Transmutation of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the power is cast using a higher level tech slot. Such a power can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the power has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks powers of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.

As a part of the action used to cast this power, you must make an attack with a ranged weapon against one creature within the power's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and gains the lightning rod debuff until the end of your next turn, as energy begins to course through them. When this power hits a target, if there is a creature within 30 ft who has the lightning rod debuff, then the energy discharges, creating an arc of lightning between them which removes the debuff and deals 1d6 lightning damage to each of them.
The power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the effects of both the ranged weapon attack and discharge deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage. Both damage rolls increase by an additional 1d6 at 11th and 17th level.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components:
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A creature you touch isn't inconvenienced by mundane delays. Traffic lights are always green, there's always a waiting elevator, and a taxi is always around the corner. The target can run at full speed through dense crowds and attacks of opportunity provoked by the target's movement are made with disadvantage.
The power also grants advantage to stealth checks, since cover is always available. Additionally, the target has advantage on all ability checks made to drive a vehicle.
If two or more creatures under the effect of the power are attempting to avoid being inconvenienced by each other, the creatures make Charisma checks each time the effects would oppose each other. The higher check of the two's power takes effect.

While your tracker droid is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it via your wristpad.
