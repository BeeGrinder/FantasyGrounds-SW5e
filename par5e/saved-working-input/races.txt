##;Jawa
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Jawas are easily identifiable by their traditional brown hooded robes, though it is not unheard of for them to wear other colors. Other notable features included their glowing yellow eyes, small stature and high pitched, quickly spoken language called Jawaese.

#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Jawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement. Most non-Jawas regard the Jawas as scavengers and thieves, a description that most Jawas actually find pleasing.<br><br>The Jawa's unofficial motto is *not to look for uses in a salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else who might find a use for it.* This is evidenced in their endless search for wares with which to trade with almost any being Jawas encounter. They have a kind of instinctive feel for machinery and electronics, notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment functioning just well enough to sell.

##;Bith
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Bith are craniopods with pale pink, yellow, or green skin, large heads, large lidless eyes, toeless feet, and long fingers. Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The Bith's internal systems are different from most humanoids, as the Bith have only one lung, and exhale through their skin. Bith also lack a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin-flaps of their cheeks.<br><br>The other Bith senses are also acute. Bith can sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other species sensed colors. Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun's, can see microscopic details of nearby objects, but are extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors is the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It is described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, Bith have high manual dexterity which helps them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with gross motor skills was only average.

##;Sith Pureblood
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Sith are a proud and violent species of humanoids that evolved on Korriban, a planet within the Horuset system in an isolated Outer Rim region called the Stygian Caldera. Sith have a larger than average number of individuals with potential to use the Force in their species, so high in fact that the entire species was considered strongly Force-sensitive.<br><br>Sith Purebloods are characterized by their expressive facial appendages, bone spurs, cranial horns, and predatory gaze.

#bs;Weight: 110 lb.x(2d4) lb.
#bs;Homeworld: Korriban
#bs;Language: Sith
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Sith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society. For the Sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though they are in an almost constant state of war, their civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society. 
#h;Names
Sith Pureblood names are not conventional. They are often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely share surnames, since they do not value family ties. When a Sith Pureblood achieves a success or victory, they often change their name to match their perceived newfound status. Since force sensitivity is common in Sith Purebloods, and their culture is built around strength, most Sith are called simply "My Lord," or some other epithet, by their underlings.

The Mon Calamari are a bipedal, amphibious species with high-domed heads, webbed hands and large, goggle-like eyes. In addition to being webbed, the Mon Calamari hand presents three suction-cup like holes on its palm, and featured five claw-tipped fingers: one opposable thumb, two long middle fingers, and two very short outer fingers.

Mon Calamari are both soft-spoken and gentle, slow to anger, and have the remarkable ability to maintain their concentration without being distracted by emotional responses. They are both inquisitive and creative, and have a near-legendary quality of being both determined and dedicated; once a Mon Calamari decides on a course of action, they are not easily swayed from that decision. They often fixate themselves on "lost causes."

##;Togruta
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Togruta have rusty skin tones ranging in hue from blue to red to green, with white pigmentation on their faces, greyish lips, and white stripes adorn various parts of their bodies. The pattern of stripes varies from individual to individual. This red and white pattern was a phenotype left over from their ancestor's camouflage that helped them to blend in with Shili's natural surroundings.<br><br>Their heads bear two montrals, with three to four head-tails, whose stripes were darker than those of the montrals. Togruta have the ability to sense the proximity and movement of physical objects around them by means of their hollow montrals, which detect space ultrasonically. Young Togrutas' montrals and posterior head-tail do not fully grow until adolescence, when their montrals curve and their final head-tail grows to the length of their other head-tails.

#bs;Skin Color: Blue, green, orange, purple, red, white, or yellow
#bs;Hair Color: None

#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Togruta have a strong sense of unity and togetherness. On their native homeworld of Shili, they rely on each other and  band together to take a stand against the massive monsters that hunt them. The creatures of Shili most often attack in groups, which was even more reason for the native Togruta to work together. While most of Shili is covered in the scrublands where the Togruta hunt their herbivorous prey, the Togruta live in small communities in the forest valleys.
#h;Names
Togruta names are typically long. Surnames are familial.
#bs;Female Names: Akoma, Maasha, Okohlo, Shola

#!;Wild Hunters. You have proficiency with the Survival skill.
#!;Languages. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Togruti. Togruti is an ornate language characterized by trills and long vowel sounds which are modified by subtle tremors in the Togruta's head-tails. This language is heavily influenced by Basic, but also incorporates some native idioms, which caused Basic-speaking Togruta to use seemingly strange expressions.
##;Trandoshan
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Trandoshans are a large, bipedal sentient species, with scaly skin which was shed roughly once every standard year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded reptiles, Trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a Trandoshan's finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward. 
#h;Visual Characteristics
#bs;Skin Color: Green, yellow, brown, orange, red
#bs;Hair Color: None
#bs;Eye Color:Yellow, orange
#bs;Distinctions: Reptilian, scaly skin, regenerative properties
#bs;Height: 5'5"+2d12"
#bs;Weight: 130 lb.x(2d6) lb.
#bs;Homeworld: Trandosha
#bs;Language: Dosh
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-Trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many Trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers. Trandoshans especially prize Wookiee pelts, which consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous Wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one's Jagganath points-effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.
#h;Names
Trandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s's. Differences between male and female names are often very subtle, but there is a higher chance for female names to contain softer sounds.
#bs;Female Names: Aksa, Idwiks, Kluks, Mezuus, Shokss

#!;Size. Trandoshans stand as tall as 7 and a half feet and can weigh over 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.
#!;Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
#!;Darkvision. Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
#!;Hold Breath. You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.
#!;Regenerative. When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a hit die to regain health as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.
#!;Saving Face. Trandoshans are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
#!;Languages. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Dosh. Dosh is characterized by its harsh grunts, hisses and growls, and its written form that used alphabetic glyphs.
##;Chiss
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
The Chiss are a near-Human species distinguished by their blue skin and glowing red eyes. Genetic analysis indicate that they are an offshoot of humanity, and it is believed that moving underground led to a divergence between them and baseline Humans. Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes generally command attention; these features make them physically striking and instantly recognizable.

#bs;Skin Color: Blue or silver
#bs;Hair Color: Black, blue, or silver
#bs;Eye Color:Red
#bs;Distinctions: Glowing red eyes, above-average night vision
#bs;Height: 4'11"+2d10"
#bs;Weight: 110 lb.x(2d4) lb.
#bs;Homeworld: Csilla
#bs;Language: Cheunh
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Chiss society is highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by a group of four affiliations known as the Ruling Families: the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini and Sabosen. These are not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government. Every Chiss claims affiliation to one of the four families, as determined by both tradition and place of birth. The family names are more of a cultural holdover; the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any Chiss could claim affiliation to any of the ruling families. In spite of the outward impression of calm and order that the Chiss like to project to outsiders, there were evidently tensions within the Families; political assassinations are a real part of Chiss political life for the Ruling Families.
#h;Names
A Chiss true-name has 3 parts, each separated by an apostrophe. The first part is their family name, the second part is their root name, and the third part is their occupation. Chiss rarely share their true-name with non-Chiss, and usually go by their root name. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.
Chiss Traits
#!;Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

#!;Darkvision. You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
#!;Martial Proficiency. You have proficiency with light and medium armor as well as the blaster pistol and sniper rifle.
#!;Languages. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Cheunh. Cheunh is a complex language that is difficult for non-Chiss to learn. Chiss take pride in this difficulty.
##;Zabrak
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Zabrak are Near-Human, but have a number of significant physical characteristics that set them apart from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these are a series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both males and females. These horns grow at puberty in varying patterns and signified that their rite of passage is drawing near.<br><br>In addition to their horns, another of the traits that make Zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage. These could symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflected their individual personalities.<br><br>Lastly, Zabraks possess a second heart.
#h;Visual Characteristics
#bs;Skin Color: Pale to dark brown, red, orange and yellow

#bs;Eye Color:Yellow, green, orange, brown, blue, red, or purple

#bs;Weight: 120 lb.x(2d4) lb.
#bs;Homeworld: Iridonia or Dathomir
#bs;Language: Zabraki
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Zabrak are often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that is not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination comes from the fact that they are a species with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able to accomplish any task that they set out to do. However, this does not lead a Zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it is not uncommon to see competition between colonies, this is not seen as a negative. The Zabraks believe that the various experiences of the different colonies only serve to add to the species's overall value throughout the galaxy.
#h;Names
Zabrak names are usually derived from the animals living on their planet. Zabraks don't use surnames.

##;Twi'lek
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Twi'leks are usually thin, although corpulent individuals were known to exist. Twi'leks are omnivores; this diet is essential given that food is scarce on their homeworld, Ryloth. Twi'leks possess multiple stomachs, an unusual trait that enables them to eat almost any food. When traveling off their homeworld, Twi'leks rarely refused food, which frequently leads to obesity among starfarers. Twi'lek society also associates obesity as a sign of affluence and success.

#bs;Homeworld: Ryloth
#bs;Language: Twi'leki
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
The natural grace and exotic beauty of the female Twi'leks make them a popular target among slave traders. Slavery is the main currency of Ryloth. Some see it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or selling orphaned children, while others see slavery as a way of saving children from growing up in Ryloth's harsh environment. A number of Twi'leks believe that slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species and preserve their culture, as the Twi'leks lack their own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how it came about, many Twi'leks live as slaves or entertainers and are considered status symbols, especially the females of rarer skin hues. Twi'leks that manage to escape from captivity usually turned to a life of thievery or prostitution, with both genders making use of their powers of seduction.
#h;Names
Twi'lek names combine their first name and a clan name into a single name, rather than having a separate surname.

##;Rodian
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
The Rodians are green-skinned humanoids from the planet Rodia. They possess distinctive faces: large, round, multifaceted eyes; tapir-like snouts; and a pair of saucer-shaped antennae on their heads, which served to detect vibrations. The flexible snouts augmented the Rodians' finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the spectrum. Due to their love of fighting and active lifestyles, most Rodians kept in good condition, normally lean and wiry; however, some wealthy Rodians became complacent and obese.

Bothan culture is guided by the philosophy and principles from the ancient text known as The Way, written by Golm Fervse'dra. In this "Bothan Way", the pursuit of power and influence is paramount. Thus, individual Bothans put their own political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species, Bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests. The volume of backstabbing, subtle character assassination and political maneuvering in Bothan society is dizzying, and results in many species stereotyping Bothans as untrustworthy. In fact, most Bothans are habitually paranoid, believing that anyone who's not working with them, is working against them. In times of crisis, the focus of Bothan society shifts to a survivalist state known as "ar'krai".

##;Weequay
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Weequays are humanoids with thick, leathery skin that ranges in color from tan to dark brown. Their faces are lipless, with a frill along each of their jowls.
#h;Visual Characteristics

#bs;Weight: 120 lb.x(2d4) lb.
#bs;Homeworld: Sriluur
#bs;Language: Sriluurian
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Weequays have the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through smell by exuding complex pheromones. This pheromonal language can not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each Weequay's pheromones are unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech is only a secondary form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom speak a whole sentence, resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.<br><br>Male Weequay often tie their hair into a long braid each year spent away from their homeworld as a tribute to their home. When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.
#h;Names
Only Weequay who have to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, take a personal name. Even then, some are simply referred to as "Weequay". In Weequay culture, individual identity is much less important than the clan. As long as the clan survives, a single Weequay is expendable. This results in a sometimes brutal culture.

Having finned hands and two bulbous black eyes, Aqualish are unable to manipulate most machinery or equipment developed by the galaxy's many species which designed these tools for beings with digits. As a result, Aqualish tend to remain on their homeworld.

This peaceful and accepting attitude goes beyond just other Rishii and was extended to all neighbours of a nest, including the many other species who colonise the lowlands of Rishi. Due to the unfavorable conditions found in the lowlands, the native avians do not understand the off-worlders' choice to live there, but were not opposed to their presence.
#h;Names

Through the development and mastery of selective breeding, genetics, and cloning, the Kaminoans were able to overcome a cataclysm that pushed them to the brink of extinction. <br><br>Kaminoans live in a caste based society, determined by the color of the Kaminoan's eyes. Gray eyed individuals handle administration and are considered of the highest-level caste; middle castes had yellow eyes and handle the skilled work; and lower castes had blue eyes and perform manual labor and other menial tasks. Although it is extremely rare, Kaminoans are sometimes born with green eyes. Those are viewed as genetically inferior and as a threat to the Kaminoans' well ordered society and as such are exterminated shortly after birth.

The number of tattoos often acts as a good indicator of how mature and/or skilled a Mirialan was. Because the more markings brings about a form of status, Mirialan society is stratified and allows the heavily marked citizens to access greater opportunities.

Most of their society uses technology similar to the rest of the galaxy, though some parts of Uvena Prime use slightly less sophisticated technology.<br><br>A minority of Shistavanen are more outgoing, and travel the galaxy's hyperlanes. Even these Shistavanen usually remain by themselves or with other Shistavanen.

For eons, the Rattataki constantly battled amongst themselves and their fellow inhabitants (represented primarily by Humans, Zabraks, Siniteens, Vollick, and Weequay) over the planet's limited resources. Despite being nearly completely isolated from the outside galaxy, the Rattataki displayed remarkable initiative and continually created new ways to kill each other.<br><br>Rattataki culture is bloody and unforgiving.

##;Toydarian
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
A mammalian species of winged, stout bodied humanoids, the Toydarians have stubby facial tusks which protruded from their lower jaw and framed a short pudgy trunk. While their stubby legs can support their body weight, Toydarians' primary mode of locomotion was their use of the wings on their upper back. Though their wings can beat as fast as ten times a second, the effort burned up large amounts of energy, causing the species to need to replenish itself often through regularly eating mass quantities of food. In order to fuel this hyperactive metabolism, Toydarians eat concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Most of the bloodiest wars in their history were fought over food supplies.

##;Devaronian
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
A bipedal mammalian species, Devaronians evolved in the dense jungles of Devaron as a hunter-gather species. Their bodies are denser than most humanoids' and as a result they were heavier than their appearance would tend to indicate. Devaronians have silver-based blood, which appears thick and black when exposed. They possess a unique blood filtration and cleansing system which processes through two livers. Because their bodies are constantly cleansed of toxins and carcinogens, the species is highly resistant to poison. To this end, sulfur is used as a stimulant on Devaron to enhance speed and strength, because inhaling it causes the substance to enter the bloodstream rapidly. Their livers struggle to eliminate sulfur from their system, meaning that long-term use can be dangerous.

Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, raising the young and running the government of Devaron. The males send money back to their homeworld to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return. The females are content with this arrangement, as they tend to view the restless males as disruptive to home life.

##;Kyuzo
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
A lanky, bipedal humanoid species, the Kyuzo originate on the gravity-heavy Outer Rim world of Phatrong. Kyuzo are tall and slender, though their appearance belies their strength and quickness. Due to the uncommon makeup of their homeworld's atmosphere, Kyuzo frequently wear corrective lenses and a highly pressurized filter mask over their faces to protect their sensitive respiratory systems and assist them in coping with uncomfortable climates like galactic standard habitable environments. As well as causing respiratory and vision problems, exposure to such conditions causes a Kyuzo to become ill within in a short period of time, interfering with their ability to concentrate and slowing them down.

##;Codru-Ji
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Codru-Ji are humanoids generally near-Human in their adult appearances, save for their four arms. While their hair, eye, and skin pigmentations tend towards earthen hues, brighter colorations such as blonde hair or blue eyes, though uncommon, also exist. Rarer still, some adults maintain a light coat of fur or elongated, pointed ears. These eccentric attributes result from their unusual childhood forms.<br><br>Codru-Ji children are actually sapient, six-legged canid creatures that cannot speak. Codru-Ji in this stage of their lives are called Wyrwulves: they mature to their more recognizable figures after reaching puberty. At that point, a blue, rubbery substance cocoons a Wyrwulf for several weeks before it emerges as a humanoid adolescent.
