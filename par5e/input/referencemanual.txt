First and foremost, I have to thank the person who got me into D&D: my buddy, Ross. That playgroup was not great, but it started my journey.
Second, I have to thank the original guinea pigs of this conversion: Drew, Eric, and Rickey. It was comically bad, but we had fun with it.
Lastly, while I would love to say that I created everything in this conversion, that wouldn't be entirely true. The following people deserve credit as well:

##;Rule Set Conversion
#h;Rule Set Conversion
This conversion has been a labor of love of mine starting three years ago. Back when I was a fledgling DM, I undertook the foolish effort of attempting the first version of this overhaul, which was comically terrible. It featured four classes, which were just severely bastardized versions of their standard counterparts. 
This version, which I will call version 1.0 as an absolute snub to my first attempt, I've been working on pretty consistently for about nine consecutive months. I've had some help from various sources (who will be credited accordingly), but for the most part this has come from mine own brain. 
This book is designed to parallel the official 5e Player's Handbook. It includes all the relevant chapters, reskinned to fit a Star Wars setting. The significant differences will be listed below.
#h;What's Different
While this expansion utilizes the base rules of 5th Edition, there are significant differences that will be illustrated here, broken down by chapter. There is more information in each chapter, as per the SRD.
#h;Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters
Reskinned for the setting, with no noteworthy differences.

#h;CHAPTER 2: SPECIES
Races relabeled to species, all of which are brand new.
#h;CHAPTER 3: CLASSES
There are ten classes. Berserker, Monk, Operative, and Scout, are mostly reskinned, with some variation to ft the setting. Fighter utilizes my homebrew of baseline combat superiority. Engineer is based of Artificer, but extrapolated to be a full caster. Guardian is based of of Paladin, and Consular is based of of Sorcerer, with changes to better ft a force-wielder. Sentinel is a reimagining of a monk, but as a 2/3 caster. Scholar is a brand new class.
#h;CHAPTER 4: BACKGROUNDS
For the most part, these are reskinned from 5E with one major difference; each background also offers a choice of feat. This is a houserule I've been using for a while that has become quite popular. You can very easily ignore this houserule if you're so inclined.
#h;CHAPTER 5: EQUIPMENT
Currency has been changed to credits, with roughly 1 gp = 10 cr. Magic items are reskinned as enhanced or modified items, as appropriate, with rarities designed to mimic those of Star Wars: the Old Republic. Equipment functions similarly, with the exception of the breakdown of weapons; rather than simply simple and martial, they are broken down into blasters, lightsabers, and vibroweapons. This also utilizes a few houserules: light, medium, and heavy shields with proficiencies collapsed into the appropriate armor, new weapon features, etc.
#h;CHAPTER 6: CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
New multiclassing requirements/profciencies, and with the exception of the spell point variant (discussed in chapter 10), the only difference is new or different feats.
#h;CHAPTER 7: USING ABILITY SCORES
Generally the same, with the exception of skills; Arcana, History, and Religion have been collapsed into Lore, with Piloting and Technology being new skills.
#h;CHAPTER 8: ADVENTURING
Basically identical with some reskinning.
#h;CHAPTER 9: COMBAT
Basically identical with some reskinning with the exception of damage types.
#ls;
#li;Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing are collapsed into kinetic damage.
#li;Ion is a new damage with improved efficacy against constructs, droids, and electronics.
#li;Radiant has become energy damage.
#li;Thunder has become sonic damage.
#le;
#h;CHAPTER 10: FORCE- AND TECH-CASTING
There are two major changes in this section:
#ls;
#li;Spells are now called powers.
#li;Cantrips are now called at-will powers.
#li;My own interpretation and simplification of the spell point variant from the DMG. Basically, casting a power at a given level costs that level + 1 points.
#le;
Spellcasting has been separated into forcecasting and techcasting.
#ls;
#li;Forcecasting uses Wisdom/Charisma and Force
#li;Points, which regenerate on a long rest.
#li;Techcasting uses Intelligence and Tech Points, which regenerate on a short rest.
#li;While a character can have both force and techcasting, they are kept completely separate.
#le;
#h;CHAPTERS 11 AND 12: FORCE AND TECH POWERS
Chapter 11 has been broken down into two chapters to keep force and tech powers separate.
#h;MONSTER MANUAL
There is a Monster Manual ready to use.
#h;STARSHIPS OF THE GALAXY
There is a space expansion optional rule set called Starships of the Galaxy, in honor of the Saga edition's book.
#h;GOING FORWARD
Additional content will be released bi-weekly, on Tuesdays, for the foreseeable future.
