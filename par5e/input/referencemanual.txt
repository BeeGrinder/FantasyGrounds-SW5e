##;Feats
#h;Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.
You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow-perhaps by a withering curse-you can’t benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.

##;Lightsaber Forms
#h;Lightsaber Forms
Certain class features, Formfighting Style, or Formfighting Mastery, offer your choice of lightsaber forms. You can’t take a lightsaber form option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
You may choose your lightsaber forms from the following options or roll on the table below to determine them randomly.
Each known form can be adopted on your turn by using your bonus action.
#bp;Ataru Form
You can leap up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
#bp;Jar’Kai Form
As a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting.
Each time you hit with an attack on this turn, you can move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks from the creature you hit.
#bp;Juyo/Vapaad Form
Until the start of your next turn, your critical hit range with weapons increases by 1.
#bp;Makashi Form

#bp;Niman Form

#bp;Shii-Cho Form

Additionally, the first time you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a weapon attack before the end of your next turn, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.
#bp;Sokan Form
Until the start of your next turn, you ignore difficult terrain. Additionally, when an opponent makes a melee weapon attack against you, you can use your reaction to move to another space within 5 feet of that opponent without provoking opportunity attacks, imposing disadvantage on the triggering roll.

As a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, you can flourish your weapon to attempt to distract an enemy you can see.

##;Player/GM notes
The Fantasy Grounds SW5e module is not meant to replace the PDF documentation.  All participants should use the PDF for rules and game mechanics.
#h;The SW5e Extension
#ls;
#li;The SW5e extension must be loaded in your campaign. Many of the features will not work if the extension is not loaded.
#le;
#h;The SW5e Module
The following module contains the game data from the SW5e Player Manual and Scum and Villainy (the monster manual).
#ls;
#li;SW5e Player Book (Class, Race, Background, NPCs, Spells, Items, etc.)
#le;
#h;How to modify anything in the module
Anything from NPCs, Equipment, Backgrounds, Race, even Classes can be copied by simply dragging it in the interface and making a copy.  You can then unlock your copy and modify it as you see fit.
#h;Issues to be aware of
#bp; Berserker Unarmored Defense
This skill does not automatically alter the AC calculation in the character sheet.  The player/GM must add the CON bonus manually.
#bp; Item Effects
Some items, like grenades, have effects or conditions that can be used in the combat tracker, many of these are included in the SW5e Supplement module.
#bp; Class, Race, Background Effects
Some classes, races, backgrounds, etc. have effects or conditions that can be used in the combat tracker, many of these are included in the SW5e Supplement module.
#bp; Equipment Parcels
The starting Equipment Packs are found as Parcels.  They have no cost, so if doing the starting wealth option, be sure to deduct the proper costs involved.
#bp; Items Button Weapon/Armor Lists
When you use the "Items" button on the right side of the screen you will see the Armor and Weapons buttons at the top of that window.  These buttons should give items by category for picking weapons and armor.
#h; Powers(Spells)
Translation of Spell(Power) terms
#ls;
#li;Tech/Force Powers Known = Number of spells known/prepared
#li;Tech/Force Points = Spell Points
#li;Tech/Force Power Level = Spell Level
#li;Max Power Level = Highest spell level that can be used
#le;
Many times in this converion to the Fantasy Grounds(FG) 5e ruleset you may see force/tech powers referred to as "spells".  This is because the FG system is not set up to handle custom powers at this time.
#bp; Spell Points
The power (spell) system in SW5e uses the alternate rules of spell points as defined in the 5e DMG.  This can be implemented in Fantasy Grounds in the character sheet Actions tab.  Use the Add Power (Star) button to add a power called "Spell Points" and finish with the "-" button.  Go to mode "Preparation" and enter the number of desired points with the period "Daily".  This will automatically reset on a long rest.
#bp; Spell Effects Coding
Many of the spells have effects for use in the combat tracker.  This is one of the primary features that makes Fantasy Grounds a fantastic gaming platform.  These effects are easily used in the Combat Tracker and the duration, saving throws, Concentration, etc. are all automatically tracked by Fantasy Grounds.
If a spell has effects coding it is indicated in the description with the text (*FG Coding).
#bp; Spells/Powers and NPCs
In the Fantasy Grounds combat tracker you should see the available spells as actions.  Many have effects that can be dragged onto the effected PC or NPC in the combat tracker.
The combat tracker can be used to automate many effects, saves, and other roles.
Please, note that the NPCs spell slot count is NOT to be used as spell slots! These numbers reflect the spell points the NPC has. Do not add them together. The spell points are shown in every spell level the NPC is capable of casting.  This is not possible to track in the combat tracker at this time.  The DM/GM must manually track an NPCs remaining spell points.
#h; NPC Issues
#bp; NPC Sizes
#ls;
#li; The AT-AT and AT-TE should be Gargantuan but is listed as Huge. 
#le;
Due to an issue with the module utility these NPCs have an incorect size category.  If this will not work in your game, you can copy the NPC and change the size category.
