##;Player/GM notes
The Fantasy Grounds SW5e modules are not meant to replace the PDF documentation.  All participants should use the PDF for rules and game mechanics.
#h;The SW5e Extension
#ls;
#li;The SW5e extension must be loaded in your campaign. Many of the features will not work if the extension is not loaded.
#le;
#h;The SW5e Modules
The following modules should all be used together
#ls;
#li;SW5e Player Book (Class, Race, Background, etc)
#li;SW5e Supplement (Spells, Items, etc)
#li;SW5e NPC Manual (NPCs, Monsters, Droids, etc)
#le;
#h;Issues to be aware of
#bp; Berserker Unarmored Defense
This skill does not automatically alter the AC calculation in the character sheet.  The player/GM must add the CON bonus manually.
#bp; Items and Equipment
Items and Equipment are in the SW5e Supplement.mod. It must be loaded to use inventory features.
#bp; Item Effects
Some items, like grenades, have effects or conditions that can be used in the combat tracker, many of these are included in the SW5e Supplement module.
#bp; Class, Race, Background Effects
Some classes, races, backgrounds, etc. have effects or conditions that can be used in the combat tracker, many of these are included in the SW5e Supplement module.
#bp; Equipment Packs
The starting Equipment Packs are found as Parcels in the SW5e Supplement module.  They have no cost, so if doing the starting wealth option, be sure to deduct the proper costs involved.
#bp; Items Button Weapon/Armor Lists
When you use the "Items" button on the right side of the screen you will see the Armor and Weapons buttons at the top of that window.  These buttons should give items by category for picking weapons and armor.
#h; Powers(Spells)
Powers(Spells) are in the SW5e Supplement.mod. It must be loaded to use caster features.
Translation of Spell terms
#ls;
#li;Tech/Force Powers Known = Number of spells known/prepared
#li;Tech/Force Points = Spell Points
#li;Tech/Force Power Level = Spell Level
#li;Max Power Level = Highest spell level that can be used
#le;
Many times in this converion to the Fantasy Grounds(FG) 5e ruleset you may see force/tech powers referred to as "spells".  This is because the FG system is not set up to handle custom powers at this time.
#bp; Spell Points
The power (spell) system in SW5e uses the alternate rules of spell points as defined in the 5e DMG.  This can be implemented in Fantasy Grounds in the character sheet Actions tab.  Use the Add Power (Star) button to add a power called "Spell Points" and finish with the "-" button.  Go to mode "Preparation" and enter the number of desired points with the period "Daily".  This will automatically reset on a long rest.
#bp; Spells/Powers and NPCs
In the Fantasy Grounds combat tracker you should see the available spells as actions.  Many have effects that can be dragged onto the effected PC or NPC in the combat tracker.
The combat tracker can be used to automate many effects, saves, and other roles.
Please, note that the NPCs spell slot count is NOT to be used as spell slots! These numbers reflect the spell points the NPC has. Do not add them together. The spell points are shown in every spell level the NPC is capable of casting.  This is not possible to track in the combat tracker at this time.  The DM/GM must manually track an NPCs remaining spell points.
#h; NPC Issues
#bp; NPC Sizes
#ls;
#li; The AT-AT and AT-TE should be Gargantuan but is listed as Huge. 
#le;
Due to an issue with the module utility these NPCs have an incorect size category.  If this will not work in your game, you can copy the NPC and change the size category.
