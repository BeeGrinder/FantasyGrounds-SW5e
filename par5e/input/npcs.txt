An autoturret is a blaster turret emplacement used to defend an area. Known for their killing power and effectiveness, they are employed by many factions throughout galactic history.
Autoturrets were used widely during the Jedi Civil War, with the Sith Empire deploying them to restrict access to the Undercity of Taris and to defend their military bases. Often, they were installed at the entrances to hidden bases, onboard capital ships, or near personal valuables.
In the later stages of the Clone Wars, portable autoturrets were used by both the Grand Army of the Republiic and the Separatist Droid Army for covering fire or to reinforce the defense of field command posts. These autoturrets became the standard equipment of clone and droid snipers, who were entrusted with their deployment.

Circuitry. The construct has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.
Electromagnetic Shielding. The AT-TE is Immune to Ion damage.
Heavy Durasteel Armor. The outer layer of the AT-TE is covered in heavy armor, making it difficult for smaller arms to damage it. Unless the damage from a single attack or effect exceeds 15 points, the AT-TE takes no damage from that attack. If the AT-TE takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, it takes damage as normal.
Piloted. The construct requires an active pilot to take any actions, and if the pilot is subjected to any conditions that the construct is not immune to, the construct is also subjected to those conditions. The pilot may take their own action or one of the actions granted by the construct.
Towering. Creatures of Medium size or smaller can stand in the AT-TE's space.
Troop Transport. The AT-TE can transport a maximum of 20 stormtroopers and five speeder bikes, which it can deploy using its Deploy Troops legendary action, or which can be fought by creatures inside of the AT-TE.
Vulnerable Interior. The AT-TE's interior is vulnerable to damage done by grenades, mines and charges, unless it is immune to that damage. It also automatically fails all Dexterity saving throws from such effects that occur in its interior.
ACTIONS
Multiattack. The AT-TE makes four attacks: one with its laser cannon volley and three with its medium repeaters.
Laser Cannon Volley. The AT-TE chooses a point within 240 ft and lets loose a blast from its heavy laser cannon that explodes in a 15ft cube around that point. Each creature within the cube must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) energy damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Medium Repeaters. Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 120/240 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d10+3) energy damage.
LEGENDARY ACTIONS
The AT-TE can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The AT-TE regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn.
Repeating Blasters. The AT-TE makes a single attack with its medium repeaters.
Deploy Troops (Costs 2 Actions). The AT-TE mobilizes some of the soldiers traveling within it. It deploys 1d4+2 Troopers. These troops appear in any unoccupied spaces within 10 ft. of the AT-TE.
##;
The All Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE), is an all terrain assault walker developed for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. The walker is used for transporting platoons of troopers and attacking enemy installations. The AT-TE's cramped rear compartment contains computer hologram communication devices and space for troopers to stand during transportation. On the back end of the machine is a large door for quick deployment of troopers. Some versions of the walker were able to scale vertical cliffs. The typical arsenal includes a top-mounted mass-driver cannon, along with six other laser cannons placed strategically around the outside of the vehicle.

Stomp. All creatures standing within the AT-ST's space or within 5 feet of it must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 39 (6d12) kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Repeating Blaster Cannon. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 120/240 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (4d10 + 3) energy damage.
rightful Presence. Each creature of the AT-ST's choice that is within 80 feet of the AT-ST and aware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the AT-ST's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
##;
The All Terrain Scout Transport (or AT-ST), also known as the chicken walker for its two-legged design, is a bipedal walker used by the Galactic Republic during the late Clone Wars and, later and more extensively, by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.
AT-STs are commonly used to screen the flanks of larger assault walkers for major ground operations. The Empire used them for swift reconnaissance and troop support. As such, they are essential for cleaning up minor resistance along the path of a planned invasion route, and can quickly eliminate small threats that evade an AT-AT's barrage. The walker is commonly used on anti-personnel hunting missions, and is piloted by two AT-ST drivers.
Despite its speed and agility, an AT-ST walker's offensive and defensive power are significantly compromised. Offensively, its weapons systems are only good against lightly armored targets at close range. Defensively, its lighter armor can repel attacks from small-arms fire, but not laser cannons, missiles, or other heavy ordnance. Its armor does not cover its entire frame, lest the walker lose its agility. Striking the walker's unprotected gyros underneath the command module can destabilize the walker and cause it to fall. Additionally, deep trenches or cable lines leveled at the height of the AT-ST's ankles and knees can cause it to trip and topple the vehicle.
The modular design of the AT-ST allows for ease in customizing the walker with armaments and tools for specific mission parameters such as mortar launchers attached to the command pod.

Mortar Launcher. The construct launches a mortar at a point it can see within 100 feet. Each creature in a 20- foot radius centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 14 (4d6) damage on a failed save, or half as much on a succesful one.
REACTIONS
Redirect. If the construct's pilot takes damage from a source the pilot is aware of and can see, the construct can use its reaction to instead take that damage.

The All Terrain Recon Transport (AT-RT), is a one-man bipedal walker used for reconnaissance and patrolling made by Kuat Drive Yards as part of their All Terrain series. It is equipped with a single seat for a pilot, as well as a repeating blaster cannon and mortar launcher, and is 3.2 meters tall and 2.9 meters long,.
Also known as the Republic scout walker, the AT-RT was used mainly during the Clone Wars by Advanced Recon Force troopers. It was the precursor to both the All Terrain Defense Pod and the All Terrain Scout Transport. During the Galactic Civil War, these walkers were adopted by both the Galactic Empire, who used Scout troopers to man the vehicles, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, who upgraded them to compete with the advancements of the Empire.
The AT-RT's were usually used for a variety of missions including ground support, police support, civil defense, and post-battle cleanup efforts. They occasionally took up position on the front lines of ground battles when difficult terrain prevented the use of larger vehicles.

The HK series assassin droid, also known as the HK series protocol droid, is a combination of an assassin droid and protocol droid. The series designation stands for "Hunter Killer," befitting their primary functions as assassins. They are manufactured by Czerka Corporation. Their ability to perform the functions of a protocol droid became a major reason for their unmatched lethality, as they could and would often act as normal (if quite sinister looking) protocol droids, thus concealing their true function and allowing them to get closer to intended targets. HK series assassin droids are equipped with an integrated emergency shield and jet pack.

##;
Massive, winged cetaceans, the aiwha were native to both the oceans and skies of the planet Kamino, capable of both swimming and flying using their wingtips to propel them through either substance. Their long, beak-like mouths featured a baleen used for filtering krill from seawater. The non-sentient species, one of a wide variety of aquatic life on Kamino, was also known as the "air whale", and were a peaceful and majestic species. Aiwha gave out bleating cries when dying.
History. When the climate of Kamino changed drastically, leading to planet-wide flooding when the ice caps melted, the native Kaminoans adapted both themselves and some of their fellow creatures to their new environment. The aiwhas were among those who were adapted using the Kaminoans' advanced cloning technologies, and became biological curiosities used as mounts to traverse Kamino's endless ocean. The Kaminoans used aiwhas as mounts, although aiwhariders traveled beneath the waters during the lashing tempests of the severe electrical storms which raged for much of the planet's year.

##;
Anoobas were aggressive pack predators native to Tatooine. Opportunistic hunters as well as scavengers, these wolflike canines would attack virtually anything smaller than themselves (such as scurriers) and would band together in packs to bring down rontos, eopies, and similar creatures.
Strong, horny beaks on their jaws assisted in the breaking of thick skeletons, while long, tufted tails helped to counterbalance the body and dissipate heat. Anoobas could vary in weight from 20 to 45 kilograms —males being larger than females—and often banded into packs of ten to twelve. These units were dominated by an alpha male and alpha female, and it was not uncommon to see entire packs waiting alongside podrace courses for an easy meal.
Like the winged urusai, accounts tell of anoobas being so engorged on meals that they are unable to move. This may be due in part to the fact that anooba mothers fed their young, born three to four at a time, through regurgitation.
Domestication. Anoobas were also known to be, like the massiff, domesticated by Tatooine's Tusken Raiders as pets and guard animals.
Off-World. Packs of escaped, adaptable anoobas imported from Tatooine roamed Coruscant alleys looking for prey. As a result, nocturnal foot traffic in certain areas was highly risky. Anoobas on Coruscant were known to howl at the planet's moons. Anoobas were sometimes caught in packs and used as gladiatorial fighting animals, for which they were given a shock collar to control their behavior.

The 74-Z speeder bike is a model of speeder bike manufactured by the Aratech Repulsor Company. It is commonly used for reconnaissance missions as well as rapid transportation in combat zones.
They were capable of reaching speeds up to and beyond five hundred kilometers per hour, and had a flight ceiling of twenty-five meters. 74-Zs were the military variant of the civilian 74-Y. They were controlled by handlebars located towards the front of the vehicle, and foot pedals slung underneath adjusted speed and altitude.
The highly maneuverable vehicles were equipped with sensor and communications devices located between the handlebars, including a comlink and a comlink-jamming device. The speeder was equipped with terrain-following sensors that linked up with the HUD in the driver's helmet. They were armed with a forward rotating blaster cannon for combat.
They were also equipped with a very powerful boost that could propel them over vast distances in a shorter amount of time. In addition, the 74-Z was stripped down to just its fundamental components, namely the engine and steering vane, in order to increase its overall speed, and as such a single, scaled-down, forward-facing blaster cannon was fixed on the undercarriage.
