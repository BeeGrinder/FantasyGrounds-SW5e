Creature Sense. The bor gullet is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each such creature, as well as each such creature's intelligence score, but it can't sense anything else about it. Droids and creatures protected by a mind blank power or other similar power cannot be perceived in this manner.
Fortified Mind. The bor gullet has advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened, and it can't be put to sleep.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the bor gullet fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Psychic Link. The bor gullet can establish a psychic link with any creature that it successfully grapples with its tentacles. Until the psychic link ends, the bor gullet can perceive everything the target senses. The target is aware that its mind is linked, and the bor gullet can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link, doing so with a successful DC 18 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The psychic link also ends if the target and the bor gullet are more than 1 mile apart, with no consequences to the target. The bor gullet can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.

Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The bor gullet emits psychic energy. Creatures of the bor gullet's choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Sense Thoughts. The bor gullet targets a creature with which it has a psychic link. The bor gullet gains insight into the target's emotional state and any thoughts that loom large in its mind (including worries, loves, and hates). The bor gullet can also make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage to deceive the target's mind into thinking it believes one idea or feels a particular emotion. The target contests this attempt with a Wisdom (Insight) check. If the bor gullet succeeds, the mind believes the deception for 1 hour or until evidence of the lie is presented to the target.
LEGENDARY ACTIONS
Options. The bor gullet can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The bor gullet regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Psychic Pulse. The bor gullet targets a creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. Enemies of the bor gullet within 10 feet of that creature take 10 (3d6) psychic damage.
Sever Psychic Link. The bor gullet targets a creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The bor gullet ends the link, causing the creature to have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the end of the creature's next turn.

If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it regains at least one point of Intelligence.
Body Thief. The brain worm initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. If it wins the contest, the brain worm burrows into the target's brain and takes control of the target's body.\rWhile inside a creature, the brain worm has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The brain worm retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Geonosian, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including force powers, tech powers, and languages.\rIf the host body takes 20 points of cold damage in a single round, the brain worm must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw using its own Constitution score, not the host's. On a failure, the brain worm leaves the body, slithering out to a space within 5 ft. of the host. After exiting the host, it is paralyzed until the start of its next turn.\rIf the host body dies, the brain worm must leave it. The brain worm is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a master heal force power. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the brain worm can voluntarily leave the body, slithering out to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it.
