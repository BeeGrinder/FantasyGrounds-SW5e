Creature Sense. The bor gullet is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each such creature, as well as each such creature's intelligence score, but it can't sense anything else about it. Droids and creatures protected by a mind blank power or other similar power cannot be perceived in this manner.
Fortified Mind. The bor gullet has advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened, and it can't be put to sleep.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the bor gullet fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Psychic Link. The bor gullet can establish a psychic link with any creature that it successfully grapples with its tentacles. Until the psychic link ends, the bor gullet can perceive everything the target senses. The target is aware that its mind is linked, and the bor gullet can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link, doing so with a successful DC 18 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The psychic link also ends if the target and the bor gullet are more than 1 mile apart, with no consequences to the target. The bor gullet can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.

Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The bor gullet emits psychic energy. Creatures of the bor gullet's choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Sense Thoughts. The bor gullet targets a creature with which it has a psychic link. The bor gullet gains insight into the target's emotional state and any thoughts that loom large in its mind (including worries, loves, and hates). The bor gullet can also make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage to deceive the target's mind into thinking it believes one idea or feels a particular emotion. The target contests this attempt with a Wisdom (Insight) check. If the bor gullet succeeds, the mind believes the deception for 1 hour or until evidence of the lie is presented to the target.
LEGENDARY ACTIONS
Options. The bor gullet can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The bor gullet regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Psychic Pulse. The bor gullet targets a creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. Enemies of the bor gullet within 10 feet of that creature take 10 (3d6) psychic damage.
Sever Psychic Link. The bor gullet targets a creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The bor gullet ends the link, causing the creature to have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the end of the creature's next turn.

If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it regains at least one point of Intelligence.
Body Thief. The brain worm initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. If it wins the contest, the brain worm burrows into the target's brain and takes control of the target's body.\rWhile inside a creature, the brain worm has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The brain worm retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Geonosian, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including force powers, tech powers, and languages.\rIf the host body takes 20 points of cold damage in a single round, the brain worm must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw using its own Constitution score, not the host's. On a failure, the brain worm leaves the body, slithering out to a space within 5 ft. of the host. After exiting the host, it is paralyzed until the start of its next turn.\rIf the host body dies, the brain worm must leave it. The brain worm is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a master heal force power. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the brain worm can voluntarily leave the body, slithering out to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it.

Gargantuan Strength. The sarlacc's weapon attacks are considered enhanced.
Burried. The sarlacc is resistant to damage from sources beyond 60 feet and immune to damage from sources beyond 120 feet.
Grasping Tentacles. The sarlacc can have up to eight tentacles at a time. Each tentacle can be attacked (AC 18; 40 hit points; immunity to psychic damage). A tentacle can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 22 Strength check against it.\rDestroying a tentacle in either way deals no damage to the sarlacc, which can extrude a replacement tentacle on its next turn, but it causes the sarlacc to spend a legendary action for no effect. If the sarlacc has no legendary actions remaining this turn to spend, the sarlacc regains one fewer spent legendary actions at the start of its next turn than it would otherwise regain. The sarlacc can be forced to spend no more than two legendary actions in this way.
ACTIONS
Multiattack. The sarlacc makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Bite.
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (4d8 + 8) kinetic damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The sarlacc has eight tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit 30 (4d10 + 8) Kinetic damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the sarlacc can't bite another target.
Swallow. The sarlacc makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the sarlacc, and it takes 35 (10d6) psychic damage at the start of each of the sarlacc's turns. A creature reduced to zero hit points this way stops taking the psychic damage and becomes stable.\rIf the sarlacc takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the sarlacc must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the sarlacc. If the sarlacc dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
Pheromones (Recharge 5-6). The sarlacc releases pheromones in a 300 ft. radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature is charmed by the sarlacc for 1 minute. While charmed this way, the target tries to get as close to the sarlacc as possible, using its actions to Dash until it is within 5 feet of the sarlacc. A charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature has advantage on saving throws against the sarlacc's Pheromones for 24 hours.
LEGENDARY ACTIONS
Options. The sarlacc can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The sarlacc regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 round.\rEach creature on the ground in the area must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 41 (6d10 + 8) sonic damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not knocked prone on a successful one. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more is pulled 15 feet downwards and towards the sarlacc.
Reel. The sarlacc pulls each creature grappled by it up to 30 feet straight towards it.
Tentacle. The sarlacc makes one tentacle attack.
Chomp (Costs 2 Actions). The sarlacc makes one bite attack or uses its swallow.
