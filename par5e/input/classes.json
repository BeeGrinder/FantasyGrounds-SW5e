To a berserker, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Berserkers are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive where the civilized don't. Berserkers come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise."

A true berserker among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Berserkers charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes berserkers perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a berserker. Some berserkers miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties."

With a roar he charges at the pair of trandoshans who dared poach his kin.\nA gamorrean snarls at the latest challenger to his authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with his bare hands as he did to the last six rivals. \nFrothing at the mouth, a nikto slams his helmet into the face of his foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.\nThese berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For every berserker, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.",

Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your berserker. Did you come from a remote planet, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where berserkers are common?\nWhat led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled planets by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to 'civilized' lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.",

He gathers his tools and runs into the ship moments before it finally takes off.\nInside, the human captain jumps into the cockpit. She nods to her droid co-pilot, who quickly begins charting a course home. Before the calculations can be completed, enemy Starfighters scream in from the clouds. The pilot rolls the ship, nimbly evading incoming fire. She reroutes the power to shields, leaving just enough for astronavigation. Just as the energy reserves near depletion, the exosphere and stars beyond blur into streaks of light. In a flash, they warp to safety.\nA Cerean officer surveys the battlefield, looking for weaknesses. When he identifies a potential problem, he keys in a quick combination in his wristpad. In a blink, a custom suit of armor assembles itself around him. As the helmet locks into place, the officer leaps into the air, flying overhead and raining destruction on the opposition.\nEvery machine needs an engineer to run it, and a living crew is no different.

The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days.\n Choose a droid companion, which is detailed at the end of this discipline. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest, you can expend 500 credits worth of materials and circuitry to interface your wristpad with that droid. It then becomes a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power. \nIf your droid is irreparable destroyed, or you want to interface with a different droid, you can spend an additional 250 credits and 1 hour to change the target of this feature. You may only have one droid companion at a time. \nYour droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you: \n * The droid obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your droid acts on its own. \n * Your droid's level equals your engineer level, and for each engineer level you gain after 3rd, your droid companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. \n * Your droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level. \n * Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your droid's abilities also improve. Your droid can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your droid can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description species otherwise. \n * Your droid can not wear armor, but you can have the armor professionally integrated into its chassis. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armor in order to integrate it into your droid. Your droid must be proficient in armor in order to have it integrated. \nAdditionally, you can upgrade your droid. Your droid companion has 3 upgrade slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Upgrade Slots column of the Engineer class table. \nOver the course of a long rest, you can change a number of upgrades up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one)."

As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or brigands.\nFor a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly.

When two city guards appear at the exit, he smiles and reaches under the table. Before they can move in, the smuggler flips the table and opens fire. The crowd scatters in panic, giving him just enough cover to escape. \nA gorgeous young human dances before an intoxicated senator in his parlor. She winks enticingly through her golden blonde hair as she sways closer. Leaning in for a kiss, the senator is instead surprised by the barrel of a hold-out blaster pistol shoved into his mouth. He has no time to shout before the assassin pulls the trigger. \nOperatives, whether good, bad, or neutral, are those who focus on a specific practice and utilize it to get the upper hand.

Scouts focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.\nScouts acquire the ability to cast tech powers through utilization of a wristpad.

In some places, scouts gather in secretive orders, though many scouts are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a rancor or a band of pirates attacks, a scout might be the first-and possibly the last-line of defense. This fierce independence makes scouts well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, scouts respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways."

Shrugging off the wave of fear that threatens to permeate her entire being, she strafes around her foe, firing shot after shot to try to penetrate the tank's thick armor.\nGlancing at his wristpad, a sullustan looks through the eyes of his tracker droid. Transmitting instructions, he sends his droid to distract the houk he's been tracking while he readies his sniper rifle for the shot.\nScouts are the first on the trail and the last to lose it, tracking their quarry for miles unimpeded.

Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work, or a significant change?\nWhat made you join up with a band of adventurers?
