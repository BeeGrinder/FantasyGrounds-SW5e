##;Jawa
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Jawas are easily identifiable by their traditional brown hooded robes, though it is not unheard of for them to wear other colors. Other notable features included their glowing yellow eyes, small stature and high pitched, quickly spoken language called Jawaese. Underneath their robes, Jawas appear to be gaunt, rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces and yellow eyes.

#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Jawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement. Most non-Jawas regard the Jawas as scavengers and thieves, a description that most Jawas actually find pleasing.
The Jawa's unofficial motto is *not to look for uses in a salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else who might find a use for it.* This is evidenced in their endless search for wares with which to trade with almost any being Jawas encounter. They have a kind of instinctive feel for machinery and electronics, notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment functioning just well enough to sell.

##;Bith
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Bith are craniopods with pale pink, yellow, or green skin, large heads, large lidless eyes, toeless feet, and long fingers. Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The Bith's internal systems are different from most humanoids, as the Bith have only one lung, and exhale through their skin. Bith also lack a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin-flaps of their cheeks.
The other Bith senses are also acute. Bith can sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other species sensed colors. Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun's, can see microscopic details of nearby objects, but are extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors is the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It is described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, Bith have high manual dexterity which helps them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with gross motor skills was only average.

##;Sith Pureblood
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Sith are a proud and violent species of humanoids that evolved on Korriban, a planet within the Horuset system in an isolated Outer Rim region called the Stygian Caldera. Sith have a larger than average number of individuals with potential to use the Force in their species, so high in fact that the entire species was considered strongly Force-sensitive.
Sith Purebloods are characterized by their expressive facial appendages, bone spurs, cranial horns, and predatory gaze.
#h;Visual Characteristics

#bs;Hair Color: Black, brown, gray, red, or white

#bs;Weight: 110 lb.x(2d4) lb.
#bs;Homeworld: Korriban
#bs;Language: Sith
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Sith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society. For the Sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though they are in an almost constant state of war, their civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society. 
#h;Names
Sith Pureblood names are not conventional. They are often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely share surnames, since they do not value family ties. When a Sith Pureblood achieves a success or victory, they often change their name to match their perceived newfound status. Since force sensitivity is common in Sith Purebloods, and their culture is built around strength, most Sith are called simply "My Lord," or some other epithet, by their underlings.

##;Mon Calamari
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
The Mon Calamari are a bipedal, amphibious species with high-domed heads, webbed hands and large, goggle-like eyes. In addition to being webbed, the Mon Calamari hand presents three suction-cup like holes on its palm, and featured five claw-tipped fingers: one opposable thumb, two long middle fingers, and two very short outer fingers. Although they are shaped like flippers, their feet can nevertheless fit into boots designed for human-like feet. The females are distinguished from the males by their more prominent chest areas.

The Mon Calamari have developed a very advanced and civilized culture. Their art, music, literature, and science show a creativity surpassed by few in the galaxy. Mon Calamari literature depicts stars as islands in a galactic sea, showing a passionate longing to explore space and discover other civilizations. Mon Calamari are both soft-spoken and gentle, slow to anger, and have the remarkable ability to maintain their concentration without being distracted by emotional responses. They are both inquisitive and creative, and have a near-legendary quality of being both determined and dedicated; once a Mon Calamari decides on a course of action, they are not easily swayed from that decision. They often fixate themselves on "lost causes."

##;Togruta
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Togruta have rusty skin tones ranging in hue from blue to red to green, with white pigmentation on their faces, greyish lips, and white stripes adorn various parts of their bodies. The pattern of stripes varies from individual to individual. This red and white pattern was a phenotype left over from their ancestor's camouflage that helped them to blend in with Shili's natural surroundings.
Their heads bear two montrals, with three to four head-tails, whose stripes were darker than those of the montrals. Togruta have the ability to sense the proximity and movement of physical objects around them by means of their hollow montrals, which detect space ultrasonically. Young Togrutas' montrals and posterior head-tail do not fully grow until adolescence, when their montrals curve and their final head-tail grows to the length of their other head-tails.
#h;Visual Characteristics
#bs;Skin Color: Blue, green, orange, purple, red, white, or yellow
#bs;Hair Color: None
#bs;Eye Color:Black, blue, green, orange, purple, yellow, or red

#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Togruta have a strong sense of unity and togetherness. On their native homeworld of Shili, they rely on each other and  band together to take a stand against the massive monsters that hunt them. The creatures of Shili most often attack in groups, which was even more reason for the native Togruta to work together. While most of Shili is covered in the scrublands where the Togruta hunt their herbivorous prey, the Togruta live in small communities in the forest valleys.
#h;Names
Togruta names are typically long. Surnames are familial.
#bs;Female Names: Akoma, Maasha, Okohlo, Shola
#bs;Male Names: Acanaar, Mukraas, Obolak, Tokrym

#!;Wild Hunters. You are proficient in the Survival skill.
#!;Languages. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Togruti. Togruti is an ornate language characterized by trills and long vowel sounds which are modified by subtle tremors in the Togruta's head-tails. This language is heavily influenced by Basic, but also incorporates some native idioms, which caused Basic-speaking Togruta to use seemingly strange expressions.
##;Trandoshan
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Trandoshans are a large, bipedal sentient species, with scaly skin which was shed roughly once every standard year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded reptiles, Trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a Trandoshan's finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward. 
#h;Visual Characteristics
#bs;Skin Color: Green, yellow, brown, orange, red
#bs;Hair Color: None
#bs;Eye Color:Yellow, orange
#bs;Distinctions: Reptilian, scaly skin, regenerative properties
#bs;Height: 5'5"+2d12"
#bs;Weight: 130 lb.x(2d6) lb.
#bs;Homeworld: Trandosha
#bs;Language: Dosh
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-Trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many Trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers. Trandoshans especially prize Wookiee pelts, which consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous Wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one's Jagganath points-effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.
#h;Names
Trandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s's. Differences between male and female names are often very subtle, but there is a higher chance for female names to contain softer sounds.
#bs;Female Names: Aksa, Idwiks, Kluks, Mezuus, Shokss
#bs;Male Names: Bossk, Tshyrrng, Varrsk, Wuikkekss

#!;Alignment. Trandoshans tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.
#!;Size. Trandoshans stand as tall as 7 and a half feet and can weigh over 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.
#!;Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
#!;Darkvision. Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
#!;Hold Breath. You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.
#!;Regenerative. When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a hit die to regain health as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.
#!;Saving Face. Trandoshans are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
#!;Languages. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Dosh. Dosh is characterized by its harsh grunts, hisses and growls, and its written form that used alphabetic glyphs.
##;Chiss
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
The Chiss are a near-Human species distinguished by their blue skin and glowing red eyes. Genetic analysis indicate that they are an offshoot of humanity, and it is believed that moving underground led to a divergence between them and baseline Humans. Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes generally command attention; these features make them physically striking and instantly recognizable.
#h;Visual Characteristics
#bs;Skin Color: Blue or silver
#bs;Hair Color: Black, blue, or silver
#bs;Eye Color:Red
#bs;Distinctions: Glowing red eyes, above-average night vision
#bs;Height: 4'11"+2d10"
#bs;Weight: 110 lb.x(2d4) lb.
#bs;Homeworld: Csilla
#bs;Language: Cheunh
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Chiss society is highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by a group of four affiliations known as the Ruling Families: the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini and Sabosen. These are not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government. Every Chiss claims affiliation to one of the four families, as determined by both tradition and place of birth. The family names are more of a cultural holdover; the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any Chiss could claim affiliation to any of the ruling families. In spite of the outward impression of calm and order that the Chiss like to project to outsiders, there were evidently tensions within the Families; political assassinations are a real part of Chiss political life for the Ruling Families.
#h;Names
A Chiss true-name has 3 parts, each separated by an apostrophe. The first part is their family name, the second part is their root name, and the third part is their occupation. Chiss rarely share their true-name with non-Chiss, and usually go by their root name. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.
Chiss Traits
#!;Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.
#!;Age. Chiss reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.
#!;Alignment. Chiss' tactical and selfish nature cause them to tend toward lawful dark side, though there are exceptions.

#!;Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
#!;Tech Resistance. Growing up around technology leaves an impact on Chiss. You have advantage on saving throws against tech powers.
#!;Darkvision. You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
#!;Martial Proficiency. You have proficiency with light and medium armor as well as the blaster pistol and sniper rifle.
#!;Languages. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Cheunh. Cheunh is a complex language that is difficult for non-Chiss to learn. Chiss take pride in this difficulty.
##;Zabrak
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Zabrak are Near-Human, but have a number of significant physical characteristics that set them apart from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these are a series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both males and females. These horns grow at puberty in varying patterns and signified that their rite of passage is drawing near.
In addition to their horns, another of the traits that make Zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage. These could symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflected their individual personalities.
Lastly, Zabraks possess a second heart.
#h;Visual Characteristics
#bs;Skin Color: Pale to dark brown, red, orange and yellow
#bs;Hair Color: Black, blonde, brown, red, or purple
#bs;Eye Color:Yellow, green, orange, brown, blue, red, or purple
#bs;Distinctions: Horns, two hearts, facial tattoos
#bs;Height: 5'1"+2d12"
#bs;Weight: 120 lb.x(2d4) lb.
#bs;Homeworld: Iridonia or Dathomir
#bs;Language: Zabraki
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Zabrak are often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that is not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination comes from the fact that they are a species with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able to accomplish any task that they set out to do. However, this does not lead a Zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it is not uncommon to see competition between colonies, this is not seen as a negative. The Zabraks believe that the various experiences of the different colonies only serve to add to the species's overall value throughout the galaxy.
#h;Names
Zabrak names are usually derived from the animals living on their planet. Zabraks don't use surnames.
#bs;Female Names: Blostopa, Mega, Novrar, Rebroke

##;Twi'lek
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Twi'leks are usually thin, although corpulent individuals were known to exist. Twi'leks are omnivores; this diet is essential given that food is scarce on their homeworld, Ryloth. Twi'leks possess multiple stomachs, an unusual trait that enables them to eat almost any food. When traveling off their homeworld, Twi'leks rarely refused food, which frequently leads to obesity among starfarers. Twi'lek society also associates obesity as a sign of affluence and success.
#h;Visual Characteristics
#bs;Skin Color: Blue, brown, dark grey, green, orange, pink, purple, red, tan, teal, white, yellow, or striped

#bs;Weight: 125 lb.x(2d4) lb.
#bs;Homeworld: Ryloth
#bs;Language: Twi'leki
#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
The natural grace and exotic beauty of the female Twi'leks make them a popular target among slave traders. Slavery is the main currency of Ryloth. Some see it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or selling orphaned children, while others see slavery as a way of saving children from growing up in Ryloth's harsh environment. A number of Twi'leks believe that slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species and preserve their culture, as the Twi'leks lack their own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how it came about, many Twi'leks live as slaves or entertainers and are considered status symbols, especially the females of rarer skin hues. Twi'leks that manage to escape from captivity usually turned to a life of thievery or prostitution, with both genders making use of their powers of seduction.
#h;Names
Twi'lek names combine their first name and a clan name into a single name, rather than having a separate surname.
#bs;Female Names: Arag'mure, Oanicfuba, Unaecripi

##;Rodian
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
The Rodians are green-skinned humanoids from the planet Rodia. They possess distinctive faces: large, round, multifaceted eyes; tapir-like snouts; and a pair of saucer-shaped antennae on their heads, which served to detect vibrations. The flexible snouts augmented the Rodians' finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the spectrum.

#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Rodian culture is obsessed with violence and death, due to behaviors and practices that are ingrained since their earliest ancestry. Their densely packed jungle homeworld is ill-suited for agriculture, requiring Rodians to compete with vicious predators for most of their food, some of which can wipe out entire Rodian villages. As the Rodians developed cunning hunting tactics to survive, the hunt became central to their culture. Eventually, having driven most of the other predators on the planet to near extinction, they began to hunt each other in various wars and gladiatorial contests.

##;Human
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Humans are an intelligent species that originated on Coruscant, but can be found on many other planets across the galaxy, including Naboo, Tatooine, and Alderaan. They come in two sexes, male and female, and give birth to live young. They are bipedal beings with a bilateral symmetry, having a front and a back end, as well as an upside and downside. Their bodies are comprised of a torso with a head and four limbs attached to it. The upper limbs, or arms, end in hands which had five fingers each; the lower ones, called legs, end in feet. The human fingers have multiple points of articulation, and one of them is an opposable thumb that allowed for fine manipulation. Finally, they have one head perched atop their torso. Many other species, including Twi'leks, Mon Calamari, or Zabraks, are referred to as "humanoids" because of their structural resemblance to humans.

##;Bothan
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Bothans are a short species of furry humanoids. Bothans are covered in fur which shifted in response to their emotional state by way of gentle ripplings. It is this trait, named Wrendui, that betrays them when members of their kind intend to be duplicitous in their dealings with others. They possess tapered pointed ears, and both males and females were known to sport beards. 
Bothans are able to interbreed with the other species, though it is rare that they do so. Such hybrids somewhat resembled baseline humans with haunches, hooves, fur, pointed ears and a long tail.

#h;SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Bothan culture is guided by the philosophy and principles from the ancient text known as The Way, written by Golm Fervse'dra. In this "Bothan Way", the pursuit of power and influence is paramount. Thus, individual Bothans put their own political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species, Bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests. The volume of backstabbing, subtle character assassination and political maneuvering in Bothan society is dizzying, and results in many species stereotyping Bothans as untrustworthy. In fact, most Bothans are habitually paranoid, believing that anyone who's not working with them, is working against them. In times of crisis, the focus of Bothan society shifts to a survivalist state known as "ar'krai". When engaged in ar'krai, all fit Bothans volunteer to defend their species from impending extinction.

##;Kel Dor
#h;BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Due to Dorin having a unique atmosphere composed of helium and a gas unique to their world, the Kel Dors are forced to wear an antiox breath mask and protective goggles whenever in atmospheres of a different composition. Without their protective goggles, Kel Dors were considered effectively blind when away from Dorin.

Wookiees greatly value honor and loyalty. Therefore, their notion of "family" encompassed much more than just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was the social institution of life debt: when a Wookiee's life was saved by someone else, regardless of the species, they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime of service to their savior and their family. Through the mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon companions and true friends, forming a "honor family."
#h;Names
