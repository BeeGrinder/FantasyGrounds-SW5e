#h;LASTING INSTITUTIONS
Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf c1ans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immorality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death's c1utches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.
Allhough some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.
