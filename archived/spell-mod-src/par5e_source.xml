Your tracker droid must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it.

Multiple tracker droids act on the same initiative. You can only see through one droid's vision at a time, but you can toggle between droids as a bonus action. Each droid must still be within 100 feet of you.</p></description><level type="number">1</level><school type="string">Transmutation</school><source type="string">Berserker, Consular, Engineer, Fighter, Guardian, Monk, Operative, Scholar, Scout, Sentinel</source><castingtime type="string">1 hour</castingtime><range type="string">10 feet</range><duration type="string">Instantaneous</duration><components type="string"/></trackerdroidinterface><tranquilizer><name type="string">Tranquilizer</name><description type="formattedtext"><p>You emit a tranquilizing dart that knocks a creature unconscious.
